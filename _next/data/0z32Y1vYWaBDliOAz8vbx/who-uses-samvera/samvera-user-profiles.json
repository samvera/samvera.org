It has given us 90%-complete solutions to most of our problems, letting us focus on the parts that are particular to our situation instead of reinventing the wheel all the time.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">How has Samvera benefited the users of your library or organization?</td><td width=\"301\">It has let us build, review, and publish digital objects much more quickly than we were able to previously.

This has brought more focus on sustainability, and taking better care of the shared software we all depend on.<div></div>Valkyrie is opening up new options for file and metadata storage, and for replacing ActiveFedora (which had become difficult to maintain over time).</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">How do you describe the Return on Investment of community work for your local resources when it comes to Samvera?</td><td width=\"301\">There are two key benefits to participating in community development: 1. It is the most direct way of making sure that the community components work the way we want them to. 2. It ensures that the community components are more sustainable, in turn making our applications more sustainable.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">What collections are you most proud of in your Samvera repository and why?</td><td width=\"301\">I'm most proud of our audio reserves collection — we were able to migrate this collection from a legacy system very quickly, thanks to the capabilities of Samvera and other related tools (like UniversalViewer).</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">Looking back at the past 12-18 months, what has your institution or organization accomplished locally thanks to the Samvera technology stack or community?</td><td width=\"301\">Migrating tens of thousands of objects, and millions of pages, from our previous repository to Figgy was fast and relatively painless.<div></div>We have been able to maintain our current functionality and add support for new content types.<div></div>We have been able to sustain ingest of more than 100K pages/month.<div></div>Implementing features like IIIF Manifest generation, drag-and-drop file management, uploading from cloud storage, and integrating with our other discovery applications.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">How do you tell potential users of Samvera on your campus about Samvera?</td><td width=\"301\">I describe it as a community-developed open source repository framework — the community development model is the key defining characteristic, as it shows more community commitment than code that is centrally developed.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n \n\n* * *\n\n#### Rosalyn Metz, Emory University, Georgia, USA\n\n<table><tbody><tr><td width=\"301\">What makes Samvera stand apart from other repository applications?</td><td width=\"301\">It is open source.

This goal is lofty and the best part of working with the community is that most of us acknowledge all the inherent biases that go into this commitment.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">What do *you* get out of the Samvera technology stack/ framework?</td><td width=\"301\">Flexibility to solve local problems that vended solutions may never address.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">What has happened within Samvera in the past year or two that you would want someone to know?</td><td width=\"301\">The Samvera community is vibrant and has grown. This growth offers many opportunities, albeit with some challenges, to make an impact in meeting common needs across institutions.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">How do you describe the Return on Investment of community work for your local resources when it comes to Samvera?</td><td width=\"301\">It is hard to quantify the return on investment and I think does a disservice to what we gain when working with many people across multiple institutions. I tend to look at pull requests and contributors on github repositories if I need some data. I ask the developers and metadata folks to share stories with me of what they have gained personally/professionally.</td></tr><tr><td width=\"301\">What collections are you most proud of in your Samvera repository and why?</td><td width=\"301\">In our IR, here are the papers deposited by faculty person Richard Joseph. Professor Joseph \"has devoted his scholarly career to the study of politics and governance in Africa with a special focus on democratic transitions, state building and state collapse, and conflict resolution.\" In our AV Repository, there are the recordings of the clarinet master class by Robert Marcellus.In our Images/DigiCollections we have many collections I am proud of, including the Overtaking of the Bursar's Office here at Northwestern in 1968.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera user profiles","date":"2019-10-29"},"sideNav":[{"date":"2021-06-28","slug":"take-a-tour-of-active-samvera-repositories","title":"Samvera Repository Tour"},{"date":"2020-01-23","slug":"samvera-adopters","title":"Samvera Adopters"},{"date":"2019-10-29","slug":"case-study-avalon-at-the-university-of-houston","title":"Case Study: Avalon at the University of Houston"},{"date":"2019-10-29","slug":"samvera-user-profiles","title":"Samvera user profiles"},{"date":"2017-02-13","slug":"case-studies","title":"Case study: Emory University"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"community-framework","title":"Community Framework"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"samvera-partners","title":"Samvera Partners"}],"sideNewsAndEvents":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"},{"date":"2021-07-15","slug":"calls-for-proposals-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Calls for proposals - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-06-15","slug":"announcing-our-partnership-with-oasis-open","title":"Announcing our Partnership with OASIS Open"},{"date":"2021-04-28","slug":"watch-samvera-virtual-connect-2021","title":"Watch Samvera Virtual Connect 2021"},{"date":"2021-04-08","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-virtual-connect","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Virtual Connect, April 20 - 21"},{"date":"2021-02-17","slug":"hyku-3-0-release-includes-new-customization-features","title":"Hyku 3.0 Release Includes New Customization Features"},{"date":"2020-12-17","slug":"seasons-greetings-from-the-samvera-community","title":"Season's Greetings from the Samvera Community"},{"date":"2020-12-07","slug":"save-the-date-april-20-21-2021-for-samvera-virtual-connect","title":"Save the Date for Samvera Virtual Connect 2021"},{"date":"2020-11-25","slug":"developer-resources-bug-hunting-in-hyrax-adding-blacklight_advanced_search-to-hyku","title":"Developer resources: Bug Hunting in Hyrax;
