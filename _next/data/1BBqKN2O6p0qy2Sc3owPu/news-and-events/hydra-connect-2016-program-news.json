Please note that the specially negotiated hotel rate is only valid until September 6th and you must register by that same date to receive a Hydra t-shirt!\n\nIf you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in 2016/17, **this is the one to attend!**\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hydra Connect 2016 Program news!","date":"2016-08-11","categories":["events"]}},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
