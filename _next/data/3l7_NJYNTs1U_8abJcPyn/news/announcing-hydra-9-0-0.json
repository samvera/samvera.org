{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe’re pleased to announce the release of Hydra 9.0.0.  This Hydra gem brings together a set of compatible gems for working with Fedora 4. Amongst others it bundles Hydra-head 9.0.1 and Active-Fedora 9.0.0.  In addition to working with Fedora 4, Hydra 9 includes many improvements and bug fixes. Especially notable is the ability to add RDF properties on repository objects themselves (no need for datastreams) and large-file streaming support.\n\nThe new gem represents almost a year of effort – our thanks to all those who made it happen!\n\nRelease notes: [https://github.com/projecthydra/active\\_fedora/releases/tag/v9.0.0](https://github.com/projecthydra/active_fedora/releases/tag/v9.0.0) [https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/releases/tag/v9.0.0](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/releases/tag/v9.0.0)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Hydra 9.0.0","date":"2015-02-09","categories":["news","software-updates"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
