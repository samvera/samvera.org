{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe Samvera Community was conceived and executed as a collaborative, open source effort from its very beginning as the Hydra Project in 2008. The concept of a supportive community of adopters around the software has always been a primary aim and we adopted the African proverb that says \"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\"\n\nInitially our work was a joint development project between Stanford University, the University of Virginia and the University of Hull in close collaboration with Fedora (now part of LYRASIS).  This core group was later expanded to include MediaShelf LLC, which has since evolved to become [Data Curation Experts](https://curationexperts.com/).\n\nAs Samvera has grown it has attracted [many adopters, and many of these have become formal Partners](https://samvera.org/samvera-partners/) in the Community. Partners commit to furthering the development of the Community. The structure of the Samvera Community is more fully described on our [Governance page](https://samvera.org/hydra-community-sourced-software/governance/).\n\nThe Samvera Community provides not only ongoing research and development of the Samvera software but also arranges meetings and training sessions which help provide face-to-face [peer support](https://samvera.org/samvera-flexible-extensible/peer-support/) of the software's deployment and use.  It supports a number of [mailing lists and other communication channels](https://samvera.org/communication/) that are used on a daily basis by adopters and potential adopters around the world.\n\nSamvera itself is _not_ (and has never been) primarily grant funded.  It _is_ distributed and open. People have asked \"what is your sustainability plan?\"  We say we’ve already passed the first hurdle—many years of self-funded productivity, and a growing code, contributor and user base, not dependent on a transition plan.  See the [Grants page on the Samvera wiki](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405211783/Grants) for additional information.  We gratefully acknowledge grant contributions from the US Institute for Museum and Library Services, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Jisc in the UK, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and others, who have funded projects which have used our framework as part of their technology stack.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Samvera Community","date":"2016-08-19"},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
