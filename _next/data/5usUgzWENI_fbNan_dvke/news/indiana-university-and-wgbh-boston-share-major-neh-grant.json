{"pageProps":{"content":"\nHydra Partners Indiana University and WGBH Boston have jointly been awarded nearly $400,000 by the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop HydraDAM2, a Hydra-based software tool that will assist in the long-term preservation of audio and video collections.\n\nHydraDAM2 will primarily address challenges posed by long-term preservation of digital audio and video files. Because these “time-based media” files are significantly larger than many other digital files managed by libraries and archives, they potentially require special solutions and workflows.\n\nAn important feature of HydraDAM2 is that it will be open source and can be used and shared freely among cultural institutions, including libraries, archives, universities and public broadcasters.\n\nHydraDAM2 is also scalable to both small and large organizations, having the ability to interact with massive digital storage systems as well as with smaller digital tape storage systems.\n\nThe full press release can be found at http://news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2014/12/neh-grants-digital-preservation.shtml\n\nCongratulations to Jon Dunn at IU, Karen Cariani at WGBH and to their teams.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Indiana University and WGBH Boston share major NEH grant","date":"2015-01-08","categories":["news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th -
