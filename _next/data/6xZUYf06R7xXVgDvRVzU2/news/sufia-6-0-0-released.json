You will notice that Sufia 5.0, the final Fedora 3-based Sufia version, is still in release candidate status. We hope to have this rectified soon.\n\nMany thanks to all the developers who have made this release possible, and to the leadership at each of their institutions for recognizing the value of this project.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sufia 6.0.0 released","date":"2015-03-31","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
