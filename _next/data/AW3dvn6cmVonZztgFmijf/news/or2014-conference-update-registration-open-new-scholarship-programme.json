The Open Repositories Steering Committee is delighted to announce a pilot Scholarship Programme for OR2014. This programme aims to expand participation by providing registration support for a small number of delegates to this year’s conference. The scholarship programme is open to librarians, repository managers, developers and researchers in digital libraries and related fields.\n\nPlease note: the OR2014 scholarship programme provides a full discount for conference registration and the conference dinner. It does not cover other costs including accommodation, travel and subsistence. It is anticipated that the applicant’s home institution will provide financial support to supplement an OR scholarship award.\n\n**Only fully-completed applications will be accepted**. The deadline for applications is Sunday, March 14, 2014.\n\nYou may apply for funding here: [http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page\\_id=412](http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=412)\n\nFor more information or to nominate someone for a scholarship, please contact the Scholarship Committee chair, William J Nixon ([william.nixon@glasgow.ac.uk](mailto:william.nixon@glasgow.ac.uk)).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"OR2014 Conference Update: Registration Open; New Scholarship Programme","date":"2014-02-21","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
