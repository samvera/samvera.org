{"pageProps":{"content":"\nSince its inception in 2008, Hydra has evolved from a loose consortium of a few like-minded people into a thriving community comprising many, many hundreds of people worldwide.  As Hydra has grown it has become more difficult for any one individual to keep track of all that is going on in, and all that has been achieved by, that community.  In late 2016 it was decided that Hydra would be well served by publishing an Annual Report each year to summarize its achievements both for those in the Hydra Community and for those who may be looking to find out more about it.\n\nA copy of the 2016 Annual Report can be [downloaded here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/download/attachments/85524985/hydra_report_2016.pdf?version=1&modificationDate=1493626022605&api=v2).\n\nWhilst we hope it will interest a wide audience, the Report is aimed primarily at managers and administrators and we would urge you to share it widely with colleagues who may find it of interest.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hydra 2016 Annual Report","date":"2017-05-01","categories":["news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
