{"pageProps":{"content":"\nA message from Jon Dunn, Chair of the Samvera Steering Group:\n\nOn behalf of the Samvera Steering Group and Richard Green our Operations Adviser, I want to express our collective deep sorrow for the death of our friend, colleague, and fellow Steering Group member, Julie Allinson. As many of you know, Julie has been an integral part of Samvera and the broader repository community for many years in her time at the University of York, CoSector, and most recently at Notch8. We know that her loss will be felt deeply at both a personal and professional level within our community. We will all miss her positive can-do attitude, wry sense of humor, and thoughtful dedication to the success of Samvera and its users.\n\nOur thoughts are with Julie’s wife Louise, her family, her Notch8 colleagues, and all who have been lucky to have Julie as a part of their life.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Julie Allinson (1974-2020)","date":"2020-05-18","categories":["news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
