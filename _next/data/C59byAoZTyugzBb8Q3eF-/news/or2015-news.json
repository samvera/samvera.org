We have accepted 6 panels, 21 24×7’s (including Rants and Raves), 37 papers and 60 posters which will all give an exciting snapshot of work in the open repositories community.\n\nThe Program Committee would like to take this opportunity to again thank all of our reviewers who took time to review workshops, papers, panels, 24×7’s and posters. Please stay tuned for more information on the schedule and interest group presentations, which we will post later in April.\n\n**\\*\\* Reminder: Register and reserve your hotel room \\*\\***\n\n[Online registration](http://www.or2015.net/registration/) for OR2015 is currently open, and participants can save $50 by registering by May 8.
