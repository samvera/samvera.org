{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe Samvera framework uses the best of current repository, search, and user-interface technologies. The separation of data and display, within the Samvera framework, promotes flexibility and extensibility.\n\n#### Flexible\n\nWithin the Samvera framework, one \"body\" -- the digital repository -- supports multiple \"heads\" or tailored, content type-specific applications.\n\n![Samvera repository structure](../images/HydraContentStructure4.gif) Where other repository systems may be tailored to a specific format or medium, requiring specific systems and expertise, the Samvera framework is flexible enough to serve multiple needs.\n\n#### Extensible\n\nThe Samvera framework is architected to extend features based on specific concerns and use-cases. Established features with long-term community commitment are available, such as:\n\n- [Browse Everything](https://github.com/projecthydra/browse-everything) allows your rails application to access user files from cloud storage, such as Dropbox, Skydrive, Google Drive, Box, and a server-side directory share\n- [LDP](https://github.com/projecthydra/ldp) provides a Linked Data Platform and allows publication of RDF data\n\nThe agile and collaborative nature of the Samvera Community also enables experimentation with cutting-edge extensions, which can be added to address unique needs, explore usefulness and possibilities, and eventually gain community commitment.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera is Flexible and Extensible","date":"2016-12-05"},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
