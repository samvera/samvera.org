{"pageProps":{"content":"\nMore than 100 people joined us on-line yesterday for this year's Samvera Virtual Connect (SVC) event.  SVC provides a chance to catch up with ongoing initiatives from across the Samvera Community at a time roughly half way between our face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings.  SVC was a mixture of 25-minute talks, shorter \"lightning\" talks and short reports back from many of our Interest and Working Groups.  Thanks go to all the presenters and to the organizers for their hard work.  The presentations can already be found [here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2017+Program) and a recording of the event will be added shortly.\n\nNext up is Samvera Connect itself, this year in Evanston, IL, from Monday 6th November to Thursday 9th November inclusive. Registration and booking information is on the [Samvera wiki here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2017).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera Virtual Connect a great success!","date":"2017-07-19","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
