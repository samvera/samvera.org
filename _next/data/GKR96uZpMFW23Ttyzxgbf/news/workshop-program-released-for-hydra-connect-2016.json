We’ll have plenty of lightning talks and breakout sessions as well. Start thinking of your great ideas now!   You’ll be hearing from us on these topics soon.\n\nIf you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in 2016/17, **this is the one to attend!**  You know what they say, “book early to avoid disappointment!”\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Workshop Program released for Hydra Connect 2016","date":"2016-07-30","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
