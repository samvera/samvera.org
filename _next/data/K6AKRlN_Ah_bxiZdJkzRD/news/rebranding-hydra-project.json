{"pageProps":{"content":"\nSome of you may be aware that the Hydra Project has been attempting to trademark its “product” in the US and in Europe.  During this process we became aware of MPDV, a German company that has a wide ranging trademark on the use of ‘Hydra’ for computer software and that their claim to the word considerably predates ours.  Following discussions with their lawyers, our attorney advised that we should agree to MPDV’s demand that we cease use of the name “Hydra” and, having sought a second opinion, we have agreed that we will do so.  Accordingly, we need to embark on a program to rebrand ourselves.  MPDV have given us six months to do this which our lawyer deems “generous”.\n\nThe Steering Group, in consultation with the Hydra Partners, has already started mapping out a process to follow over the coming months but will welcome input from the Hydra Community – particularly help in identifying a new name, a matter of some urgency.  We will be especially interested in hearing from anyone with prior success in any naming and (re-)branding initiatives!  Rather than seeing this as a setback we are looking at the process as a way to refocus and re-invigorate the project ahead of new, exciting developments such as cloud-hosted delivery.\n\nPlease share your ideas via any of Hydra’s mailing lists.  If you use Slack you may like to look at a new Hydra channel called #branding where some interesting ideas are being discussed.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Rebranding the Hydra Project","date":"2017-02-14","categories":["news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-09-08","slug":"2022-Julie-Allinson-Award-Recipient","title":"2022 Julie Allinson Award Recipient"},{"date":"2022-08-01","slug":"Samvera-Partner-Profile-WGBH","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: WGBH"},{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th -
