The interest in and commitment to the community is organization-wide; last fall we sent over twenty participants to Hydra Connect from across five technology and service divisions; our showing this year will be equally strong, our enthusiasm tempered only by the registration limits.”\n\nWelcome Michigan!  We look forward to a long collaboration with you.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Michigan becomes the latest Hydra Partner","date":"2015-08-31","categories":["news"]}},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
