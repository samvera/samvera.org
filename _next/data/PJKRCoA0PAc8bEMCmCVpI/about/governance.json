{"pageProps":{"content":"\n### Samvera Governance\n\n#### Samvera Partners\n\nSamvera's Partners are the heart of the Community and formally share responsibility for its development.  They set technical and Community direction; they contribute design and code; they organize events; they conduct training; they help orient new adopters; they write documentation; and they advance the Community overall.  The Partners have a monthly conference call and meet annually at Samvera Connect. [Learn more about Partnership on the Samvera wiki.](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405210590/Samvera+Community+Framework#Partnership)\n\n#### Samvera Board\n\nThe Board oversees governance for the Community and manages its legal, financial, identity and communication concerns. It serves as a formal representative for the Community, and the ultimate point of escalation, when either is needed. The Board consists of nine elected members from Partner organizations, each serving two year terms. [Learn more about the current Board on the Samvera wiki.](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405210594/Samvera+Board+membership)\n\n#### Adopters\n\nThe Samvera Community is open; it includes active participants and users who may not be Partners but still add to the Community or derive benefit from it.  All are welcome!\n\n#### Interest, Working and Developer Groups\n\nInterest, Working and Developer Groups span both Samvera's Partners and other Community members. They address specific topics (e.g. \"Service Management\"), tasks (e.g. updating the Samvera website), and technical issues (e.g. architectural direction and code commits).  The Groups hold regular meetings, normally on-line, and conduct their business in an open and transparent way.  Membership of Groups is open with the exception that all developers must have a [Contributor License Agreement](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405211651/Samvera+Community+Intellectual+Property+Licensing+and+Ownership) in place before code will be accepted from them, and all new code is subject to a peer review process. [See current Groups on the Samvera wiki.](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/422319284)\n\n### Philosophy\n\nSamvera is first and foremost about the people participating in a community anchored by the belief that together, we can achieve so much more than we could alone.  The Samvera Community thrives due to its diversity in people, institutions, perspectives and skills aligned around a common, shared purpose to provide solutions for sustainable, durable asset management. This shared purpose is continually affirmed and evolved for, and by, the Community.  Resources are provided that foster communication and collaboration both virtually and face-to-face, acknowledging the power of connectedness.\n\nSamvera realizes that one size (or solution) will not fit all. Samvera offers a flexible framework rather than a single closed application.  It is designed so that adopters can each have their own design mix of features; variation is part of the plan.  Equally, the Community recognizes that not all adopters will have the resources to create and maintain their own Samvera variant and to that end offers an evolving array of full-featured “solution bundles” that can be used by smaller teams or offered as a hosted solution.\n\nSamvera encourages new adopters, people with varied expertise, deep engagement and so organizes (and encourages others to organize) interest groups, working groups, training and workshops.\n\nSamvera believes in being inclusive, open and transparent in all it does: code, designs, and discussions.\n\nSamvera provides software designed to make a developer’s life easier.\n\nSamvera Partners are committed to contributing back to the project: code for the core, documentation, design patterns and more.\n\nSamvera designs for re-use.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Governance and Philosophy","date":"2016-10-07"},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
