{"pageProps":{"content":"\nMuch of Samvera's development is driven by its Interest and Working Groups.  These groups come together to discuss and work on matters of particular importance to the Samvera Community at any given time.  Interest Groups are essentially for discussion around a particular topic; Working Groups are created to perform specific tasks - each Working Group has specific deliverables and a timeframe in which to create them.\n\nSamvera's Interest and Working Groups operate in a transparent and inclusive manner.  Each proposed new Group sets out a charter and posts an open invitation for participants from across the Community.  Generally the meetings are held online and the minutes are posted on Samvera's wiki. Unless there is a clear reason to do otherwise, Groups use existing Samvera mailing lists for communication so that their progress can be shared with the broader Community.  Interest Groups can give rise to Working Groups and vice versa but when a particular Group has fulfilled its objectives it is dissolved.\n\nA list of the current Groups, and links to their pages, can be found on the [Samvera wiki](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/422319284/Interest+Group+IG+and+Working+Group+WG+Hub).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Interest and Working Groups","date":"2017-04-11"},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2021-08-04","slug":"samvera-code-of-conduct-and-anti-harassment-policy","title":"Samvera Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy"},{"date":"2017-04-11","slug":"interest-working-groups","title":"Interest and Working Groups"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"licensing","title":"Licensing"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"samvera-community-sourced-software","title":"Samvera is Community Sourced Software for Repository Solutions"},{"date":"2016-12-05","slug":"faq","title":"FAQ"},{"date":"2016-10-07","slug":"governance","title":"Governance and Philosophy"},{"date":"2016-10-07","slug":"philosophy","title":"Philosophy"}],"sideNewsAndEvents":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"},{"date":"2021-07-15","slug":"calls-for-proposals-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Calls for proposals - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-06-15","slug":"announcing-our-partnership-with-oasis-open","title":"Announcing our Partnership with OASIS Open"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
