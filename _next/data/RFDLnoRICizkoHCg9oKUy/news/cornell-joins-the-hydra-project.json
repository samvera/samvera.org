{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe are delighted to announce that Cornell University has become the Hydra Project’s 22nd partner. In their letter of intent, Anne R. Kenney, the University Librarian writes:\n\n“The Cornell University Library has a long history of commitment to collaborative approaches for meeting the needs of research libraries, as well as to openly sharing the results of our work.  We see the Hydra Project and Community as a critical partner in our own strategic goal to standardize and simplify our digital repositories and workflows.  Through our own work on the open source VIVO project and its open community, we are already very familiar with the benefits of working collaboratively to develop software tools in support of research, scholarship and the creative arts. Finally, given that Cornell is the original home of Fedora, a key component of the Hydra Framework, we feel a particular affinity for the Hydra Project, its approaches, and its goals.”\n\nWe look forward to a long and productive partnership.  Welcome, Cornell!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Cornell joins the Hydra Project","date":"2014-03-07","categories":["news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
