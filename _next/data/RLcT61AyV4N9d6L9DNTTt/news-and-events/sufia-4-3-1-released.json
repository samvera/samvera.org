It also includes support for Blacklight 5.8 and a good number of bugfixes.\n\nThanks to Carolyn Cole, Michael Tribone, Valerie Maher, Adam Wead, Misty DeMeo, and Mike Giarlo for their work on this release.\n\nView the upgrade notes and a complete changelog on the release page:[https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v4.3.1](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v4.3.1)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sufia 4.3.1 released","date":"2014-12-07","categories":["software-updates"]}},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
