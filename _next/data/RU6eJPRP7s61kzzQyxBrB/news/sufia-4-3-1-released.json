{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe are pleased to announce the release of version 4.3.1 of the Sufia gem.  (The 4.3.0 version was a misfire, so the upgrade path goes from 4.2.0 directly to 4.3.1.)\n\nThe 4.3.1 release of Sufia includes the ability to store users’ ORCID identifiers and display them in the user profile, and includes enhancements to usage statistics. It also includes support for Blacklight 5.8 and a good number of bugfixes.\n\nThanks to Carolyn Cole, Michael Tribone, Valerie Maher, Adam Wead, Misty DeMeo, and Mike Giarlo for their work on this release.\n\nView the upgrade notes and a complete changelog on the release page:[https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v4.3.1](https://github.com/projecthydra/sufia/releases/tag/v4.3.1)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sufia 4.3.1 released","date":"2014-12-07","categories":["software-updates"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
