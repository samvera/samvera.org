{"pageProps":{"content":"\nSamvera has grown into a vibrant, highly active community including more than 30 Partners who formally support our work and development.  A look at our [Partners page](https://samvera.org/samvera-partners/) or a glance at the footer section on this page will show you that these supporting organizations and institutions cover a range of cultural heritage sectors (libraries – academic and public, museums, broadcasters), large and small.  Not only is there a range of sectors represented, but Samvera’s Partners and adopters are spread around the world; whilst most are on the North American continent there is a growing number in Europe and a small number elsewhere.\n\nWe believe that no single system can provide the full range of repository-based solutions for a given institution’s needs and that no single institution can resource the development of a full range of solutions on its own. Samvera software is free and open source, available under an Apache 2 license.  \n\nThe Partners have a vested interest in sustaining the products of Samvera in support of their own digital collections, some of national and international importance, and thus in sustaining the products for others in the community. Partnership is earned by demonstrating support in ways that serve the community as a whole, and the [Samvera Community Framework](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405210590/Samvera+Community+Framework) describes the mutually beneficial structure of activity that occurs. Further evidence Samvera’s strength can be seen in the [Partner Letters of Commitment](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/426510729/Samvera+Partners). It is the combination of community, partnership, and technology plus a shared interest in long term digital preservation objectives that makes Samvera what it is. \n\nSamvera is committed to being an active, supportive community for its many users; in the furtherance of that commitment, the Community regularly examines the ways in which it attempts to deliver that support.  More, it continually asks whether it is suited to the demands of the next few years or whether improvements need to be made. Thus, Samvera Community is continually evolving to reflect needs in the Community and to reflect advancements in the technologies and standards that it embraces.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Sustainability","date":"2016-12-06"},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
