{"pageProps":{"content":"\nOf interest to the Hydra community:\n\nDecember 1, 2015\n\nRead it online: [http://www.or2015.net/scholarship-programme/](http://www.or2015.net/scholarship-programme/)\n\nThe Tenth International Conference on Open Repositories ([http://www.or2015.net/](http://www.or2015.net/)) , OR2015, will take place on June 8-11, 2015 in Indianapolis (Indiana, USA). The organizers are pleased to invite you to apply to the 2015 Scholarship Programme.\n\nThe Open Repositories Steering Committee is delighted to announce that for OR2015 we will again be running our Scholarship Programme. This programme will enable us to provide support for a small number of full registered places for the 2015 conference in Indianapolis. The programme is open to librarians, repository managers, developers, and researchers in digital libraries and related fields. Applicants submitting a paper for the conference will be given priority consideration for funding (please provide details of your submission in the application form).\n\nTwo questions in the application form ask ‘What is it about Open Repositories that interests you’ and ‘What do you expect to gain from attending the conference?’ You may wish to prepare answers to these before completing the form, as the responses to these will be critical to the success of your application.\n\nPlease note: the Scholarship provides funding only for a full conference registration (including dinner and the poster reception). It does not cover other costs such as accommodation, travel, and subsistence. It is anticipated that the applicant’s home institution will provide financial support to supplement the OR Scholarship Award.\n\nApplication Form [http://goo.gl/Vv03F4](http://goo.gl/Vv03F4) (via GoogleDocs)\n\nThe deadline for applications is 30 January 2015.\n\nLOOKING BACK, MOVING FORWARD: OPEN REPOSITORIES AT THE CROSSROADS\n\nOR2015 is the tenth OR conference, and this year’s overarching theme reflects that milestone: Looking Back/Moving Forward: Open Repositories at the Crossroads. It is an opportunity to reflect on and to celebrate the transformative changes in repositories, scholarly communication, and research data over the last decade. More critically however, it will also help to ensure that open repositories continue to play a key role in supporting, shaping, and sharing those changes and an open agenda for research and scholarship.\n\n \n\nOR2015 will provide an opportunity to explore the demands and roles now expected of both repositories and the staff who develop, support, and manage them – and to prepare them for the challenges of the next decade. We welcome proposals on this theme, but also on the theoretical, practical, organizational, or administrative topics related to digital repositories.\n\nFull details on the Call for Proposals\n\n[http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/](http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CALL for OR2015 Scholarship Programme Applicants","date":"2014-12-03","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
