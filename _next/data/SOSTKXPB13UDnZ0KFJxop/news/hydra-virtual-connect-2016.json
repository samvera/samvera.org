{"pageProps":{"content":"\n## What is Hydra Virtual Connect?\n\nHydra Virtual Connect (HVC) is an opportunity for Hydra Project participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Hydra Connect meetings. Hydra is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. HVC will give the Hydra community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Hydra Connect 2016 in Boston in October.\n\nSuggestions for an event such as this have come from a number of members of the Hydra community, and the idea was further discussed and refined at the Hydra Power Steering meeting in March 2016.\n\n## When will Hydra Virtual Connect take place?\n\nHydra Virtual Connect 2016 will take place on **Thursday, July 7** from 11:00 AM – 2:00 PM EDT / 8:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT / 16:00-19:00 BST / 15:00-18:00 UTC.  Reserve the time slot!!!\n\n## Further details\n\nFurther details can be found on [the HVC wiki page here.](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Virtual+Connect+2016)\n\nBooking details for the face-to-face Hydra Connect in Boston this October will be announced shortly.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hydra Virtual Connect 2016","date":"2016-06-05","categories":["events","news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-09-08","slug":"2022-Julie-Allinson-Award-Recipient","title":"2022 Julie Allinson Award Recipient"},{"date":"2022-08-01","slug":"Samvera-Partner-Profile-WGBH","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: WGBH"},{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th -
