{"pageProps":{"blogPost":null,"markdownContent":{"content":"\nThe Program Committee for Hydra Connect 2016 are pleased to announce details of the presentations, panel and breakout sessions that have been arranged for this year’s conference.  You can find these via the [Connect 2016 wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016).  This year there are more timetabled sessions than ever before and participants will have some tough decisions to make about which ones to attend; we are hoping (though this is yet to be confirmed) that we will be able to make, and subsequently post, audio recordings of all the sessions so that you can listen to those that you couldn’t attend in person.\n\nHydra Connect this year runs from Monday 3rd to Thursday 6th October at the Boston Public Library (some Monday workshops are at nearby Northeastern University).  Booking is going well and if you haven’t yet registered now would be a good time to do so!  [Full details of registration and the conference hotel](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016%3A++Workshops) are on the wiki – please note that the specially negotiated hotel rate is only available until September 6th which is also the deadline for reserving your highly sought after Hydra Connect 2016 t-shirt!  If you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in 2016/17, **this is the one to attend!** \n\nAll institutions attending will be asked to provide a poster for Tuesday’s poster session; watch your email around August 26th for details about preparing and printing these. On September 2nd, or thereabouts., we’ll send out details about how to propose lightning talks.  We look forward to seeing you in six weeks (yes, just six weeks…)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hydra Connect 2016: Program details released!","date":"2016-08-19","categories":["events","news"]}},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
