{"pageProps":{"content":"\nDon't forget that this year's Samvera Virtual Connect is coming up soon!\n\nTuesday, July 18, 2017\n\n11:00 AM - 2:00 PM EDT / 8:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT / 16:00-19:00 BST / 15:00-18:00 UTC\n\nSamvera Virtual Connect is an opportunity for Samvera Community participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings. Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera Community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Samvera Connect 2017 in Evanston in November.\n\nFor more information, and **to register**, go to [SVC's wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2017).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera Virtual Connect - 18th July","date":"2017-07-04","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
