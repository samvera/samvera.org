{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThis year's Samvera Virtual Connect will take place on 14th and 14th May.\n\nSamvera Virtual Connect (SVC), is an opportunity for Samvera Community participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings. Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Samvera Connect 2020.\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Fall conference this year will also take place on line - we're busy working on the details.  In the meantime, why not join us for the Spring event?  [All the details are here](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2020).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera Virtual Connect","date":"2020-05-04","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
