Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards [Samvera Connect 2018](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2018) in Salt Lake City in October.  See the [Virtual Connect wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2018) for further information.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera Virtual Connect registration open","date":"2018-07-04","categories":["events","news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-09-08","slug":"2022-Julie-Allinson-Award-Recipient","title":"2022 Julie Allinson Award Recipient"},{"date":"2022-08-01","slug":"Samvera-Partner-Profile-WGBH","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: WGBH"},{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"}],"sideNewsAndEvents":[{"date":"2022-09-08","slug":"2022-Julie-Allinson-Award-Recipient","title":"2022 Julie Allinson Award Recipient"},{"date":"2022-08-01","slug":"Samvera-Partner-Profile-WGBH","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: WGBH"},{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
