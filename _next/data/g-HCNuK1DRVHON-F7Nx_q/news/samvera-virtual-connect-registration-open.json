Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards [Samvera Connect 2018](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2018) in Salt Lake City in October.  See the [Virtual Connect wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2018) for further information.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera Virtual Connect registration open","date":"2018-07-04","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
