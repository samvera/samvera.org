{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe Samvera Community is built around a core group of Partners committed to the success of the project and more importantly to the success of each other.  There are also many institutions and individuals that have formally committed to the sustainability of the Community through code contributions, participation in working or interest groups, helping with documentation, design, or planning.  No contribution is too small.  If you are interested in contributing to the Samvera Community or just interested in Samvera in general read more about the Community [here](https://samvera.org/hydra-partners/community-framework/).
