{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe're excited to announce the release of Hyku 4.0. This major release includes many new features such as Cross Site Search, Theming enhancements, and a whole new in-app with ENV defaults configuration process. This is a major release as adopters will need to update their deployment processes to take in to account new ENV vars which more closely align to Hyrax and the removal of config/settings.yml and config/settigns/{env}.yml files.\n\nFull release notes are available on the [Hyku GitHub release page](https://github.com/samvera/hyku/releases/tag/v4.0.0).\n\nThe features in this release include features sponsored by the [Advancing Hyku Grant](https://advancinghyku.io/), [Hyku for Consortia](https://www.hykuforconsortia.org/) project, the British Library, and many more.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0","date":"2022-05-16","categories":["software-updates"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
