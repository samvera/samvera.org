{"pageProps":{"content":"\nSamvera's annual Connect conference has gone virtual this year, like so many others.  Nevertheless, we've put together an exciting program of workshops, presentations, posters and community social events that we hope will make up for not being able to meet in person.  The main events are on Friday 10/23 and Monday - Thursday 10/26 - 10/29 with workshops on 10/22.  The conference runs from 11:00am EDT to approximately 2:30pm EDT each day.\n\nYou can find full details of the conference on [**our wiki pages at this link.**](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2020)  There you'll also find details of our online shop where you can get themed conference goodies to make up for the lack of our usual free conference t-shirt.\n\n**Connect 2020 On-line is free of charge but registration is required. To register:**\n\n1. Create an account on the conference Sched website: [https://sc2020.sched.com/](https://sc2020.sched.com/)\n2.
