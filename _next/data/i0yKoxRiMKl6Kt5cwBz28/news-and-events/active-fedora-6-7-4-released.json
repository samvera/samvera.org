{"pageProps":{"content":"\n\\*\\*\\*  See edit below \\*\\*\\*\n\nEarlier this week Greg Kellogg released a new version of the Ruby RDF library (1.1.2),  this breaks the rdf-rdfxml (1.0.1) library which Active Fedora depends on.\n\nThe updated Active Fedora gem contains a dependency that ensures we get a working combination of those libraries.  This is the sole change in this release.\n\nIf you are not upgrading to 6.7.4 it is highly recommended that you add this line to your Gemfile:\n\ngem ‘rdf’, ‘~> 1.1.1.1’\n\nThanks to Justin Coyne of DCE for the alert and the fix.\n\n\\*\\*\\*Edit\\*\\*\\*\n\nMr. Kellog has yanked the rdf 1.1.2 gem and released a fixed version (1.1.2.1), so this is no longer an issue.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Active Fedora 6.7.4 released","date":"2014-01-16","categories":["news","software-updates"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
