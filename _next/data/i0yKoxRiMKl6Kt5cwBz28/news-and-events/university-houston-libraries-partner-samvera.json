{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe University of Houston Libraries (UHL) have become Samvera's latest formal Partner.\n\nUH Libraries has been actively involved in the Samvera Community through the Metadata Interest Group, CONTENTdm Migration Working Group, and Hyku efforts.\n\nIn addition to direct Samvera Community involvement, UH Libraries supports Samvera through activities in the Fedora repository community. UH Libraries helped initiate the South Central States Fedora Users Group (SCSFUG) with Texas Digital Library (TDL) to form a growing multi-state community of library faculty and staff who are actively working on or interested in Fedora-based repository projects.  They have hosted events to continue to conversation and support for our base repository system.\n\nIn support of Samvera community growth and sustainable solutions for digital libraries, UH Libraries is applying for IMLS grant for a collaborative approach with institutions within Samvera Community to build a toolkit called Bridge2Hyku (B2H). This toolkit intends to offer capacity for libraries and cultural heritage institutions in the adoption of Hyku and to help establish a framework for sustainable data migration to Hyku. The B2H Toolkit will include software as well as documentation and guidelines that will serve as crucial components for quicker and wider adoption of Hyku.\n\nUHL’s current efforts include a next generation digital eco-system that integrates multiple systems: ArchiveSpace, Archivemetica and Hyku/Avalon. Links for this project can be found at:\n\n- UHL – Digital Libraries Github, [https://github.com/uhlibraries-digital](https://github.com/uhlibraries-digital)\n- UHL BCDAMS Blog, [http://sites.lib.uh.edu/wp/bcdams-blog/](http://sites.lib.uh.edu/wp/bcdams-blog/)\n\nUHL has been a strong advocate for the open source Samvera Project at local and national conferences when presenting on their Hyku implementation. UHL is ready to contribute code, documentation and expertise in support of the Samvera Project.\n\nJoin us in welcoming University of Houston Libraries!  Look for the UHL team at Samvera Connect 2017!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"University of Houston Libraries Partner with Samvera","date":"2017-08-18","categories":["news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
