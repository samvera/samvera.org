{"pageProps":{"content":"\nSamvera is first and foremost about the people participating in a community anchored by the belief that together, we can achieve so much more than we could alone.  The Samvera Community thrives due to its diversity in people, institutions, perspectives and skills aligned around a common, shared purpose to provide solutions for sustainable, durable asset management. This shared purpose is continually affirmed and evolved for, and by, the Community.  Resources are provided that foster communication and collaboration both virtually and face-to-face, acknowledging the power of connectedness.\n\nSamvera realizes that one size (or solution) will not fit all. Samvera offers a flexible framework rather than a single closed application.  It is designed so that adopters can each have their own design mix of features; variation is part of the plan.  Equally, the Community recognizes that not all adopters will have the resources to create and maintain their own Samvera variant and to that end offers an evolving array of full-featured “solution bundles” that can be used by smaller teams or offered as a hosted solution.\n\nSamvera encourages new adopters, people with varied expertise, deep engagement and so organizes (and encourages others to organize) interest groups, working groups, training and workshops.\n\nSamvera believes in being inclusive, open and transparent in all it does: code, designs, and discussions.\n\nSamvera provides software designed to make a developer’s life easier.\n\nSamvera Partners are committed to contributing back to the project: code for the core, documentation, design patterns and more.\n\nSamvera designs for re-use.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Philosophy","date":"2016-10-07"},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2021-08-04","slug":"samvera-code-of-conduct-and-anti-harassment-policy","title":"Samvera Code of Conduct and Anti-Harassment Policy"},{"date":"2017-04-11","slug":"interest-working-groups","title":"Interest and Working Groups"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"licensing","title":"Licensing"},{"date":"2016-12-06","slug":"samvera-community-sourced-software","title":"Samvera is Community Sourced Software for Repository Solutions"},{"date":"2016-12-05","slug":"faq","title":"FAQ"},{"date":"2016-10-07","slug":"governance","title":"Governance and Philosophy"},{"date":"2016-10-07","slug":"philosophy","title":"Philosophy"}],"sideNewsAndEvents":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"},{"date":"2021-07-15","slug":"calls-for-proposals-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Calls for proposals - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-06-15","slug":"announcing-our-partnership-with-oasis-open","title":"Announcing our Partnership with OASIS Open"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
