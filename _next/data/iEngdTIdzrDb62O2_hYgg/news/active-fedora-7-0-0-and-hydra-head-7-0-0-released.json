{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe are pleased to announce major releases for the Active-Fedora and Hydra-Head gems bringing them both to version 7.0.0\n\nThe major changes in this release include a refactoring of the associations API and complete rewrite of the RDF components. Additionally this release requires Blacklight 5.3+ which brings with it a dependency on Bootstrap 3. Further, some new deprecations appear which help you get your application ready for the future versions of active-fedora.\n\nThanks very much to all the contributors especially Tom Johnson and Trey Terrell for their hard work.\n\nThe current versions of all Hydra gems can be accessed through [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation](http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Active-Fedora 7.0.0 and Hydra-Head 7.0.0 released","date":"2014-04-02","categories":["news","software-updates"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"},{"date":"2021-07-15","slug":"calls-for-proposals-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Calls for proposals - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-06-15","slug":"announcing-our-partnership-with-oasis-open","title":"Announcing our Partnership with OASIS Open"}],"sideNewsAndEvents":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-07-20","slug":"take-a-virtual-tour-of-samvera-repositories","title":"Take a Virtual Tour of Samvera Repositories"},{"date":"2021-07-15","slug":"calls-for-proposals-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Calls for proposals - Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-06-15","slug":"announcing-our-partnership-with-oasis-open","title":"Announcing our Partnership with OASIS Open"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
