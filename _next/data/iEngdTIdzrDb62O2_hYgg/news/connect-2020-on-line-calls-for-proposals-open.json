{"pageProps":{"content":"\nThe Program Committee for Samvera Connect 2020 On-line is pleased to announce its Call for Proposals (CfP) of workshops, presentations and lightning talks. As in the past, our goal is to serve the needs of attendees from an ever-widening range of experience and background (potential adopters, new adopters, expert Samverans; developers, managers, sysops, metadata librarians, etc.).\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 means this year’s conference events will be held online. However, we are committed to providing a rich and varied program although the time available for presentations and lightning talks will be concentrated  As part of the overall program, we are working on the details of a novel approach to a poster session (CfP and details in due course) and we intend to again run our successful mentoring program and to arrange some social events; we will shortly be seeking volunteers to help with these last two items.  A companion developer congress is being planned to take place shortly after Connect.\n\nPlease submit proposals for workshops to be held on Thursday 22nd October via Zoom (or similar) [using the form you will find here](https://forms.gle/Ux6V3BhX7pDca7cd7).  You can propose a workshop that you will run or that you would like to see run by others. The workshop CfP closes on Sunday 16th August.\n\nPlease submit proposals for presentations (20 minutes + 5 minutes questions) or lightning talks (seven minutes) to be given on Monday 26th - Wednesday 28th October via Zoom Webinar [using the form you will find here](https://forms.gle/ePDDz7QULdWyfJDS9).  The CfP for presentations closes on Sunday 30th August and for lightning talks on Sunday 4th October.\n\nYou may find it helpful to refer to the [workshop program](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Workshops+program%3A+Tuesday+22nd+October) and/or [presentations program](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Thursday+presentations+and+panels) from last year’s conference.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Connect 2020 On-line Calls for Proposals open","date":"2020-07-20","categories":["events","news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th -
