{"pageProps":{"content":"\nOur generous hosts at Washington University in St Louis have made provision for the award of up to three scholarships to Connect 2019 (22-25 October, Washington University in St Louis).  These scholarships will cover the cost of conference registration and three nights' accommodation only.  They do not cover travel expenses, or evening meals.\n\nThe Samvera Connect Scholarships Committee is committed to promoting diversity within the Samvera Community. Anyone who identifies with a group that is historically under-represented at such events (including, but not limited to, African Americans, Latinx, Indigenous Peoples, people with disabilities, cis women, people of transgender experience, and people of non-binary gender) is encouraged to apply.\n\nApplications are open to all Samvera Community participants but priority consideration will be given to first time attendees, early career professionals, applicants from historically under-represented groups, and international applicants.  Closing date 21st August 2019.  [Details and application form here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Scholarships).\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Samvera announces Scholarships for its Connect 2019 conference","date":"2019-08-01","categories":["events","news"]},"sideNav":[{"date":"2022-06-15","slug":"call-for-samvera-connect-2022-proposals","title":"Call for Samvera Connect 2022 Proposals"},{"date":"2022-06-13","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-university-of-hull","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: University of Hull"},{"date":"2022-05-19","slug":"samvera-partner-profile-get-to-know-hyku-for-consortia","title":"Samvera Partner Profile: Get to Know Hyku for Consortia"},{"date":"2022-05-16","slug":"announcing-the-release-of-hyku-4-0","title":"Announcing the release of Hyku 4.0"},{"date":"2022-05-11","slug":"samvera-virtual-connect-2022-recordings","title":"Samvera Virtual Connect 2022 recordings"},{"date":"2022-04-25","slug":"program-now-available-for-samvera-virtual-connect-may-4-5-2022","title":"Program now available for Samvera Virtual Connect, May 4-5, 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-06","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-4-15-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals extended to 4/15 for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2022-04-05","slug":"samvera-community-2021-annual-report","title":"Samvera Community 2021 Annual Report"},{"date":"2022-03-15","slug":"call-for-proposals-for-samvera-virtual-connect-2022","title":"Call for Proposals for Samvera Virtual Connect 2022"},{"date":"2021-10-04","slug":"see-the-schedule-and-register-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"See the schedule and register for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-09-22","slug":"registration-now-open-for-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Registration now open for Samvera Connect 2021 Online"},{"date":"2021-08-31","slug":"call-for-proposals-extended-to-sept-13th-samvera-connect-2021-online","title":"Call for proposals EXTENDED to Sept 13th -
