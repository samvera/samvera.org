{"pageProps":{"content":"\nWe are pleased to announce major releases for the Active-Fedora and Hydra-Head gems bringing them both to version 7.0.0\n\nThe major changes in this release include a refactoring of the associations API and complete rewrite of the RDF components. Additionally this release requires Blacklight 5.3+ which brings with it a dependency on Bootstrap 3. Further, some new deprecations appear which help you get your application ready for the future versions of active-fedora.\n\nThanks very much to all the contributors especially Tom Johnson and Trey Terrell for their hard work.\n\nThe current versions of all Hydra gems can be accessed through [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation](http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation)\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Active-Fedora 7.0.0 and Hydra-Head 7.0.0 released","date":"2014-04-02","categories":["news","software-updates"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
