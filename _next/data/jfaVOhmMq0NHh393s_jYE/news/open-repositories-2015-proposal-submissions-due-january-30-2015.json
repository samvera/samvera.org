{"pageProps":{"content":"\nA reminder from the OR folks that the deadline for main conference and interest group proposal submissions and scholarship program applications is January 30, 2015.\n\nThe Tenth International Conference on Open Repositories, OR2015 <[http://www.or2015.net/](http://www.or2015.net/)\\>, will be held on June 8-11, 2015 in Indianapolis (Indiana, USA). The organizers are pleased to invite you to contribute to the program. This year’s conference theme is:\n\nLOOKING BACK, MOVING FORWARD: OPEN REPOSITORIES AT THE CROSSROADS\n\nOR2015 is the tenth OR conference, and this year¹s overarching theme reflects that milestone: Looking Back/Moving Forward: Open Repositories at the Crossroads. It is an opportunity to reflect on and to celebrate the transformative changes in repositories, scholarly communication and research data over the last decade. More critically however, it will also help to ensure that open repositories continue to play a key role in supporting, shaping and sharing those changes and an open agenda for research and scholarship.\n\nOR2015 will provide an opportunity to explore the demands and roles now expected of both repositories and the staff who develop, support and manage them – and to prepare them for the challenges of the next decade.\n\nWe welcome proposals on this theme, but also on the theoretical, practical, organizational or administrative topics related to digital repositories. We are particularly interested in:\n\n1. SUPPORTING OPEN SCHOLARSHIP, OPEN SCIENCE, AND CULTURAL HERITAGE ONLINE\n2. MANAGING RESEARCH (AND OPEN) DATA\n3. INTEGRATING WITH EXTERNAL SYSTEMS\n4. RE-USING REPOSITORY CONTENT\n5. EXPLORING METRICS AND ASSESSMENT\n6. MANAGING RIGHTS\n7. DEVELOPING AND TRAINING STAFF\n8. BUILDING THE PERFECT REPOSITORY\n\nSubmissions that demonstrate original and repository-related work without these themes will be considered, but preference will be given to submissions which address them.\n\nKEY DATES\n\n- 30 January 2015: Deadline for submissions\n- 27 March 2015: Submitters notified of acceptance to general conference\n- 10 April 2015: Submitters notified of acceptance to Interest Groups\n- 8-11 June 2015: OR2015 conference\n\nSUBMISSION PROCESS\n\n- General Conference: <[http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/#submission](http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/#submission)\\>\n- DSpace Interest Group: <[http://www.or2015.net/dspace-ig/](http://www.or2015.net/dspace-ig/)\\>\n- EPrints Interest Group: <[http://www.or2015.net/eprints-ig/](http://www.or2015.net/eprints-ig/)\\>\n- Fedora Interest Group: <[http://www.or2015.net/fedora-ig/](http://www.or2015.net/fedora-ig/)\\>\n\nSUBMISSION SYSTEM: <[https://www.conftool.com/or2015/](https://www.conftool.com/or2015/)\\> PDF format is preferred for submissions.\n\nCODE OF CONDUCT:  <[http://www.or2015.net/code-of-conduct/](http://www.or2015.net/code-of-conduct/)\\>\n\nSCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMME:  <[http://www.or2015.net/scholarship-programme/](http://www.or2015.net/scholarship-programme/)\\>\n\nPROGRAM CO-CHAIRS\n\n- Holly Mercer, University of Tennessee\n- William J Nixon, University of Glasgow\n- Imma Subirats, FAO of the United Nations\n\ncontact: <[or15-program-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:or15-program-chairs@googlegroups.com)\\>\n\nLOCAL HOSTS\n\n- Indiana University Bloomington Libraries\n- University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library\n- Virginia Tech University Libraries\n\ncontact: <[or2015@indiana.edu](mailto:or2015@indiana.edu)\\>\n\nCONFERENCE WEBSITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA\n\n- website: <[http://or2015.net/](http://or2015.net/)\\>\n- twitter:@OR2015Indy and #or2015\n- Facebook: <[https://www.facebook.com/or2015](https://www.facebook.com/or2015)\\>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Open Repositories 2015: proposal submissions due January 30, 2015","date":"2015-01-20","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
