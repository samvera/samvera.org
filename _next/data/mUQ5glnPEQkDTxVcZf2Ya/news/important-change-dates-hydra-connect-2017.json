{"pageProps":{"content":"\nApologies, but after our announcement, just before Christmas, of dates for Hydra Connect 2017 it became apparent that they clashed with a PASIG conference which, at that point, had not been widely advertised.  This would have represented a conflict of interest for a significant number of our Hydra community\n\nAccordingly, the dates for Hydra Connect 2017 have been changed.  It will still be hosted by Northwestern University but the dates are now Monday November 6th – Thursday November 9th, 2017.  This year we have made the decision to use a conference hotel and the event will take place at the Hilton Orrington near the University.  Please update your calendars!\n\nFurther information via emails and the Hydra wiki in due course!\n","frontmatter":{"title":"IMPORTANT - Change of dates for Hydra Connect 2017","date":"2017-01-30","categories":["events","news"]},"openGraphData":{"og:description":"Samvera™ is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.
