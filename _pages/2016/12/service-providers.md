Samvera is open source software and free to any would-be user, but the project benefits from a number of commercial firms and individual contractors that are active in the community and offer for-fee services to interested institutions, such as consulting, implementation, hosting, training, and more.

This page serves as a directory for many of the known and active Samvera (formerly Hydra) service providers in the community, and is meant as a starting point. A listing (or the absence of one) does not represent an endorsement or testimony to the nature or quality of the work.  

If you are a service provider and would like to be listed on this page, please contact the Samvera Community Manager, Heather Greer Klein, heather@samvera.org.
