These strategies may be repurposeable in other production system migrations: adopting a validatable data model, abstracting the datastore behind an API, separating concerns, testing metadata mappings against production, writing reports to understand complex data, templating unit tests, performing a rolling migration, and incorporating migration into ongoing project work.","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://zenodo.org/records/12579359"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"underline"}],"value":"Looking up from the weeds: seeing what's next for OA by learning from the past","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" (Richard Jones, Cottage Labs) -  the history of Open Access from the perspective of the author, a software engineer in the sector for nearly 25 years. ","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"paragraph"}],"nodeType":"list-item"},{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":"","nodeType":"text"},{"data":{"uri":"https://zenodo.org/records/12579378"},"content":[{"data":{},"marks":[{"type":"underline"}],"value":"Open COUNTER-conformant Institutional Repository Usage Statistics (IRUS):Thinking Beyond Top 10 Lists","nodeType":"text"}],"nodeType":"hyperlink"},{"data":{},"marks":[],"value":" (Shelia Rabun, Lyrasis;
