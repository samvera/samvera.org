title: "Samvera is Community Sourced Software for Repository Solutions"
---

Samvera is a vibrant and welcoming community of information and technology professionals who share challenges, build expertise, and create sustainable, best-in-class solutions, making the world’s digital collections accessible now and into the future.

Samvera was conceived because we believe that no single system can provide the full range of repository-based solutions for a given institution’s needs, and that no single institution can resource the development of a full range of solutions on its own. Samvera means ‘togetherness’ in Icelandic, and espouses the value of working together to create solutions that address shared challenges. The Samvera (originally called Hydra) Community benefits from the breadth and depth of knowledge that its adopters bring and, in particular, from the contributions of its [formal Partners](/samvera-partners) who commit to its long term development and viability.

Working together, the Samvera Community continues to develop a common infrastructure with the flexibility to tailor solutions to specific demands and workflows. Our software leverages other “best in class” open source software to provide a framework within which adopters can create a customized solution or choose from “off-the-shelf” solution bundles. The software embraces open, international standards, where possible. The community adheres to acknowledged “best practice” for software design and development, learning from each other without duplicating effort.

Questions are always welcome. Take a look in our FAQ and across the website, or join us on our samvera-community list or Samvera Slack channel to get input from the community.
