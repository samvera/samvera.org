### What is Samvera?

Samvera is an Icelandic word meaning something like “togetherness.” The Samvera Community is a global community of technologists who create and maintain repository software; you can’t install Samvera, but you can install the software solutions we support including [Avalon Media System](https://www.avalonmediasystem.org/), [Hyrax](hyrax.samvera.org), and [Hyku](hyku.samvera.org). Institutions around the world rely on Samvera Community supported software to provide access to their digital content. 

Samvera is also a community of practice where software developers and library technologists can support and learn from one another. We have active participation from metadata specialists, repository managers, user experience professionals, and others who contribute their expertise to ensure the software stays relevant and responsive to changing needs.

**[Hyku Interest Group](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/419533203)**

The Hyku Interest Group meets to discuss the Hyku repository application. Based on Hyrax, Hyku is intended to be an easy-to-install, easy-to-configure, feature-rich multi-tenancy solution. Hyku is designed to reduce barriers to effective asset management and preservation for collections and content types of many kinds.

**[Metadata Interest Group](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212126)**

The Samvera Metadata Interest Group (SMIG) is interested in working together on base metadata recommendations for the Samvera Community. The scope of this group concentrates primarily on metadata as it relates to Samvera projects such as Hyrax, Hyku, and Avalon Media System. Types of metadata for which the group has or intends to create recommendations include technical, structural, descriptive, and rights metadata.

**[Repository Management Interest Group](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212548)**

Provides a support network and sounding board for anyone working with repositories (no matter what your title!) to ask questions and share implementations. The Group provides collective input on the Hyrax roadmap and feature development, providing use cases, proposals, and providing real-time input on implementation of features.

### Samvera for Developers

#### Where do I start?

The easiest way to get started developing with Samvera is to install and configure Hyrax.  Two resources will aid you with this - our [general documentation](http://samvera.github.io/) and the [GitHub page with specific installation instructions](https://github.com/samvera/hyrax#getting-started). While it is possible to create your own Samvera application by assembling the right components, and this has been a common practice in the Samvera Community in the past, ongoing maintenance of home grown solutions will be more expensive than sharing maintenance costs with the rest of the Community. 

#### Development Resources

You can find some instructional documentation in [our knowledge base](http://samvera.github.io/index.html). The [samvera-tech mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/samvera-tech/join) is a good resource, as is the #dev channel on Samvera Slack. Official Samvera code repositories are in the Samvera [Github organization](https://github.com/samvera), and emerging projects are in samvera\-labs. 

#### Samvera for Metadata Professionals

The Samvera Community contains many metadata professionals who are working together to share patterns and establish best practices. You can connect with many of them via the [Samvera Metadata Interest Group](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/405212126/Samvera+Metadata+Interest+Group), the [samvera-tech mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/samvera-tech), and on the #metadata channel of Samvera Slack.
