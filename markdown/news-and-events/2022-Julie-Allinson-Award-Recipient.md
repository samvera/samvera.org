tamsin was jointly nominated by Julie Hardesty (Indiana University), Jessica Hilt (University of California, San Diego), and Chrissy Rissmeyer (University of California, Santa Barbara). In their nomination letter, they nominated tamsin for the award “in recognition of their outstanding technical leadership, mentorship, and tireless efforts in addressing and raising awareness about issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our community.” 

They also highlighted that tamsin is “generous with their knowledge, always willing to pair with new and existing members of the Samvera Community. They are patient with new contributors, encouraging members to take tickets that are outside their comfort zone with the offer of support and education throughout the process.” 

The letter ends by noting that “the efforts of one person can truly make a difference. Julie Allinson was one such individual and tamsin johnson is as well.”

Congratulations tamsin, and thank you for your outstanding and continuing contributions to the Samvera Community!
