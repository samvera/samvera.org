_From the [Hyku for Consortia](https://hykuforconsortia.palni.org/news/pledge-drive-to-advance-the-samvera-hyrax/hyku-valkyrization-project) Team_

Hyku for Consortia is [leading a pledge drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10A0_UhYiKyC28qQCgeWtsD4x3V24qifDarX6zPRShlg/edit?usp=sharing) to raise funds to move Valkyrie for Hyrax work forward in a series of development sprints by [SoftServ ](https://softserv.scientist.com/)from May-June 2023. The goal is to collect $50,000-$100,000 in funds to advance this work as soon as possible.

Valkyrie for Hyrax has been a promise to Samvera users for a few years. So much excellent work has been done here, but community resources have been constrained to get it across the line. Completing this work would provide a number of important benefits to the community:

* Long-desired options beyond Fedora 4 for existing Samvera users, including Postgres or Fedora 6 backed Hyrax
* Removal of what has been a “let’s wait” blocker for institutions who have delayed upgrades
* Attractiveness of Samvera solutions to potential adopting institutions who have been hearing about Valkyrie and waiting to act
* Interest from service providers and a path to keep their engagement in the community viable

### Scope:

There are three main milestones that we as a community want to accomplish, to be targeted in this order of priority: 

* Milestone 1 is to create a fully functioning version of Hyrax that is backed by Postgres. 
* Milestone 2 is to pave a well-established workflow for live-migrating an existing Fedora 4-backed Hyrax repository to Valkyrie Postgres-backed Hyrax repository. 
* Milestone 3 is to have the Fedora 6 Valkyrie adapter fully working in Hyrax. 

The pledge drive is focused on Milestone 1 with any remaining funds dedicated to Milestone 2 in the May-June 2023 period.

If you have end-of-year funds, and would like to support immediate work on this project, please consider joining the pledge. See the [scope of work document for full details and how to pledge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10A0_UhYiKyC28qQCgeWtsD4x3V24qifDarX6zPRShlg/edit?usp=sharing).

Organizations can also contribute developer and/or software testing time to the community effort. Multiple institutions will be leading sprints in August and September 2023. More information will be shared soon.
