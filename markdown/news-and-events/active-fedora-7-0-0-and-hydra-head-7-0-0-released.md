We are pleased to announce major releases for the Active-Fedora and Hydra-Head gems bringing them both to version 7.0.0

The major changes in this release include a refactoring of the associations API and complete rewrite of the RDF components. Additionally this release requires Blacklight 5.3+ which brings with it a dependency on Bootstrap 3. Further, some new deprecations appear which help you get your application ready for the future versions of active-fedora.

Thanks very much to all the contributors especially Tom Johnson and Trey Terrell for their hard work.
