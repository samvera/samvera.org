We’re pleased to announce the release of Hydra 9.0.0.  This Hydra gem brings together a set of compatible gems for working with Fedora 4. Amongst others it bundles Hydra-head 9.0.1 and Active-Fedora 9.0.0.  In addition to working with Fedora 4, Hydra 9 includes many improvements and bug fixes. Especially notable is the ability to add RDF properties on repository objects themselves (no need for datastreams) and large-file streaming support.

The new gem represents almost a year of effort – our thanks to all those who made it happen!
