We are delighted to announce that booking for Hydra Connect 2015 is now open.  This year’s Connect takes place in Minneapolis, MN, from Monday September 21st to Thursday September 24th.  Details at[https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2015](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2015%C2%A0%C2%A0)   It is intended to publish a draft program in the first week of July.

Hydra Connect meetings are intended to be the major annual event in the Hydra year.  Hydra advertises them with the slogan “as a Hydra Partner or user, if you can only make it to one Hydra meeting this academic year, _this is the one to attend!”_

The three-day meetings are preceded by an optional day of workshops.  The meeting proper is a mix of plenary sessions, lightning talks, show and tell sessions, and unconference breakouts.  The evenings are given over to a mix of conference-arranged activities and opportunities for private meetings over dinner and/or drinks!  The meeting program is aimed at existing users, managers and developers and at new folks who may be just “kicking the tires” on Hydra and who want to know more.

We hope to see you there!
