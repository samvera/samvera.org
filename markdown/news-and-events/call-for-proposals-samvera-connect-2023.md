We want to have the schedule available for everyone to review when making a case to attend our first in person Samvera conference since 2019!

Our goal is to offer content valuable to attendees from a wide range of experiences and backgrounds – from new and potential adopters of Samvera technologies, to expert Samverans. We want to serve developers, administrators, repository managers, sysops, metadata librarians, and everyone else who makes up the Samvera Community.

We are seeking proposals for the following:



* 90 minute, 3 hour, and 6 hour workshops (workshop day is October 23rd)
* 20 minute presentations
* 40 minute panels 
* 5 minute lightning talks
* Posters

Please help us make this year’s Samvera Connect conference a great event!
