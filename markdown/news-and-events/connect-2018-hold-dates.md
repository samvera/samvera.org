We are pleased to announce that Samvera's 2018 Connect conference will be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City during the week beginning Monday 8th October. The Monday will actually be a Samvera Partner meeting, Connect workshops will take place on Tuesday 9th and the Connect conference itself will run from the morning of Wednesday 10th to lunchtime on Friday 12th. Space will be available on the Friday afternoon (as well as at other times during the week) for any groups that want to take the opportunity for face-to-face meetings. We anticipate that registration will open early in June - in the meantime hold the dates and please feel free to share this information with others!

Advance notice that the subsequent Connect will be in the fall of 2019 at Washington University in St. Louis. Nothing like planning ahead...
