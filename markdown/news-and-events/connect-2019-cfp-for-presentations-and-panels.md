The Program Committee for Samvera Connect 2019 is pleased to announce the Call for Proposals of Presentations and Panels. As in the past, our goal is to serve the needs of attendees from an ever-widening range of experience and background (potential adopters, new adopters, expert Samverans; developers, managers, sysops, metadata librarians, etc.). We are seeking proposals for 20-minute presentations (+5 minutes for questions), short (25 minute) and long (50 minute) panels. The CFP will remain open until 4th August; between now and then you can expect a number of reminders and some pointers for areas we would particularly like to see covered. Notifications will follow shortly after the closing date. CFPs for lightning talks and posters will follow nearer the time of the conference.

Proposals should be submitted using [the form that you will find here](https://forms.gle/A1M7AZRKreog3RE56). So – get your thinking caps on and help us make this year’s Samvera Connect conference another great event! FYI: Registration will open on July 1st and there is already a lot of relevant information (including the workshops schedule) on the conference website/wiki at [connect2019.samvera.org](https://connect2019.samvera.org). Please feel free to share this information with interested colleagues or relevant lists.
