Save the dates!Â  Replacing our COVID-cancelled fall conference, we are pleased to announce that Samvera Connect 2020 on-line will take place as follows:

Thursday 22nd October will be an on-line workshops day.

Friday 23rd October will be our 'plenary' sessions.

Monday 26th - Wednesday 28th will feature our wide range of presentations.

The plenary and presentation sessions will each be spread over a three-hour block timed to allow maximum participation from members of our Community spread across many time zones - exact times to be confirmed.

We are working hard to bring you an on-line, but interactive, 'poster session' and to try and capture the important social aspects that a face-to-face conference would have offered.

Watch this space...
