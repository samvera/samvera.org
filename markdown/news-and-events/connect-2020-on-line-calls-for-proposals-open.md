The Program Committee for Samvera Connect 2020 On-line is pleased to announce its Call for Proposals (CfP) of workshops, presentations and lightning talks. As in the past, our goal is to serve the needs of attendees from an ever-widening range of experience and background (potential adopters, new adopters, expert Samverans; developers, managers, sysops, metadata librarians, etc.).

The impact of COVID-19 means this year’s conference events will be held online. However, we are committed to providing a rich and varied program although the time available for presentations and lightning talks will be concentrated  As part of the overall program, we are working on the details of a novel approach to a poster session (CfP and details in due course) and we intend to again run our successful mentoring program and to arrange some social events; we will shortly be seeking volunteers to help with these last two items.  A companion developer congress is being planned to take place shortly after Connect.

Please submit proposals for workshops to be held on Thursday 22nd October via Zoom (or similar) [using the form you will find here](https://forms.gle/Ux6V3BhX7pDca7cd7).  You can propose a workshop that you will run or that you would like to see run by others. The workshop CfP closes on Sunday 16th August.

Please submit proposals for presentations (20 minutes + 5 minutes questions) or lightning talks (seven minutes) to be given on Monday 26th - Wednesday 28th October via Zoom Webinar [using the form you will find here](https://forms.gle/ePDDz7QULdWyfJDS9).  The CfP for presentations closes on Sunday 30th August and for lightning talks on Sunday 4th October.
