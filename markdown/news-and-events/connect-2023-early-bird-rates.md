Samvera Connect 2023 is [open for registration](https://samveraconnect2023.sched.com/) and **Early Bird rates are available through September 23rd**. The conference will take place from October 23rd - 26th at the [Philadelphia Marriott Old City](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1689017553914&key=GRP). Samvera Connect is an opportunity for individuals interested in the Samvera Community and related repository technologies to convene, collaborate, and advance the open source community.

Samvera Connect 2023 is set to be a collaborative experience that brings together a diverse range of library and archives professionals, developers, and technologists to learn from each other about the latest trends and innovations in Samvera’s repository technologies. The conference will feature an array of activities including **five pre-conference workshops, a dynamic plenary day, poster reception, and an insightful two-track presentation day.** The conference also offers an optional Developers Congress day, providing developers and technologists a unique chance to join forces and collaborate on Samvera Community feature planning and development projects.

One highlight of the conference will be the keynote address by Dr. Paul D. Barclay, Professor of History at Lafayette College. Dr. Barclay's presentation will shine a spotlight on the success story of the East Asia Image Collection (EAIC) within the Lafayette Digital Repository, powered by Samvera's Hyrax open source repository software. The talk will underscore the remarkable journey of collaboration between diverse stakeholders – administrators, developers, metadata experts, image-capture specialists, student assistants, donors, and academic historians – that has reimagined, enriched, and evolved the EAIC over the past decade. Dr. Barclay's insights will delve into the practical and intangible benefits of constructing digital repositories.

Situated in the heart of the historic district, the Philadelphia Marriott Old City provides a convenient and exciting location for connecting and learning from one another. Attendees are encouraged to secure their accommodations by booking through the [Samvera Connect group rate link](https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1689017553914&key=GRP) by September 22nd.
