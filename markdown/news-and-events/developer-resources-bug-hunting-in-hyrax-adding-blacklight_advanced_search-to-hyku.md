Bess Sadler from [Notch8](https://www.notch8.com/) has created two excellent guides that may be helpful to developers working in [Hyrax](https://hyrax.samvera.org/) or [Hyku](https://hyku.samvera.org/) applications:

- [Bug Hunting in Hyrax](https://www.notch8.com/bug-hunting-in-hyrax/): A well-documented process for finding a bug in a Hyrax application
- [Adding blacklight\_advanced\_search to Hyku](https://www.notch8.com/adding-blacklight_advanced_search-to-hyku/): a how-to guide for adding Blacklight Advanced Search to a Hyku application

Have you or your organization written a similar guide we should highlight for the Samvera Community? Get in touch on Slack so we can amplify your work.
