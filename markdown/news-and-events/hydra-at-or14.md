This may be of interest to those going to [Open Repositories 2014 in Helsinki (9 – 13 June)](http://or2014.helsinki.fi/ "Open Repositories 2014 website").  We’ve put together a [list of all the Hydra-related workshops and talks](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Events%2C+presentations+and+articles "Hydra events page")that we know of (if you know we’ve missed one, please get in touch).  I think it’s fair to say that we’ll be well represented!  In addition to the formal content being given, Hydra folks will be manning a table in the circulation area of the conference.

If you’re still undecided about going, maybe this will sway you?
