\*\* Ahead of vacation time, please take note…\*\*

We are delighted to announce that booking has opened for the second Hydra Connect meeting which will be held in Cleveland, Ohio this fall.  It will take place at Case Western Reserve University from Tuesday 30th September – Friday 3rd October 2014.  The booking site can be found at [http://connect-cleveland2014.eventbrite.com](http://connect-cleveland2014.eventbrite.com/)

For folks who haven’t attended a Hydra meeting before, this is our annual opportunity to connect with other Hydra users, find out what Hydra is all about, and get involved; for established Hydranauts it is an opportunity to share experience with friends old and new, and to see what is going on across the Hydrasphere.  There will be plenty for new and prospective adopters of Hydra as well as for established users.
