We are pleased to announce the draft program for Hydra Connect #2.  The meeting is being held at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, from Tuesday 30th September to Friday 3rd October, 2014.  The timetable is available from the Connect #2 information page on the Hydra wiki –[https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2+-+Fall+2014](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2+-+Fall+2014) – where you can also find further details about the conference and about booking procedures.

Hydra Connect #2 is the major Hydra gathering planned for 2014/15. If you’re a Hydra Partner and can attend only one meeting in the 2014/2015 academic year, this should be it.  Adopters of Hydra, or those considering its adoption, who are not Partners are equally welcome to attend and, as you will see from the program, a significant number of the meeting sessions Tuesday to Thursday have been specifically tailored to their needs.

If you intend coming to this Hydra Connect meeting it is becoming urgent that you book soon!  Over half the tickets for the event have already been sold and the preferential hotel rate that we have negotiated ends on Thursday August 28th.
