We’re more than pleased to tell you that Hydra’s second Connect meeting, to be held in Cleveland 30 September – 3rd October, is a sell-out!  Not only have we sold all the tickets, we have a waiting list of people hoping we might manage to find a little more space.  We’re looking forward to seeing 160 faces, friends old and new, at Case Western Reserve University in three weeks.
