The [Hydra Connect 2016](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016%3A++Workshops) Program Committee thought that you might appreciate an update on how planning is going, so…

The [list of workshops for Monday](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016%3A++Workshops) has been available on the wiki for some time now.  We shall shortly be asking delegates to indicate which sessions they hope to attend so that we can allocate appropriately sized rooms and so that convenors can send out any pre-workshop materials to them.

The conference proper will start on Tuesday with a plenary session, a mix of key presentations and lightning talks as at previous Connects.  On Tuesday afternoon we shall have the very popular poster session for which we ask a poster from every attending institution – please start planning!  As last year, we shall arrange for printing at a FedEx branch near the conference venue for those who prefer not to travel with a poster tube!  Details soon.

We received far more suggestions for Connect sessions than we have had in the past – in particular there were a lot of suggestions for panels and breakouts.  We’re pleased to report that by extending the “traditional” Wednesday morning parallel tracks into the afternoon we have managed to accommodate everyone’s requests.  We’ve timetabled presentations in 30-minute slots (a 20-minute presentation, 5 minutes or so for questions and a bit of time for possible movement between rooms).  Panel and breakout sessions have been timetabled in one hour slots (50-55 minutes plus movement time).  If you are involved in presenting or facilitating any of these sessions you should hear from us with confirmation at the end of next week when we have finished tweaking the timetable.  We have included a number of slots for lightning talks and we’ll start soliciting these at the end of the month.  We anticipate having the Tuesday and Wednesday programs on the wiki in ten days’ time or so and you’ll find there is so much to choose from that, inevitably, you will have to make some hard choices about which sessions to attend.  We are hoping (though this is yet to be confirmed) that we may be able to make, and subsequently post, audio recordings of all the sessions so that you can listen to those that you couldn’t attend once you return home.

Thursday morning has been given over to unconference sessions and we hope to make “Sessionizer” available to delegates in about three weeks’ time so that you can start requesting slots.  Thursday afternoon is available for Interest Groups and Working Groups to have face-time.  We shall make any spare room capacity on Thursday available for booking to allow ad-hoc gatherings, Birds of a Feather sessions, and the like.

Booking is beginning to fill up and if you haven’t yet registered now would be a good time to do so!  [Full details of registration and the conference hotel](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016%3A++Workshops) are on the wiki. Please note that the specially negotiated hotel rate is only valid until September 6th and you must register by that same date to receive a Hydra t-shirt!

If you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in 2016/17, **this is the one to attend!**
