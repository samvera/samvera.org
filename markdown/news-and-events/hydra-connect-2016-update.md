Hydra Connect 2016 takes place from Monday October 3rd to Thursday October 6th in Boston, MA.  [Full details of the conference can be found in its wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016).

**Poster Show and Tell**

Tuesday afternoon at HC2016 will largely be given over to an open session of posters and possibly demos where attendees will have ample chance to mingle, find out what others are doing with Hydra and ask detailed questions.  We ask that all institutions with staff attending HC2016 try to provide at least one poster about what they have done/are doing/plan to do with Hydra!  There is a list of institutions [on this page in the wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016+Poster+sign-up+and+details+of+local+printing+arrangements)– **please sign up** if you haven’t already done so.  The page also has details of local printing arrangements, should you wish to take advantage of them.  For display, the local Organizing Committee will provide easels; they will also provide stiff backing for 24″ x 36″ posters.  If you decide to produce 36″ x 48″ posters you will need to have them printed on foam core or otherwise provide a rigid backing of your own.

**Registration and hotels**

Registration is going well and the Sheraton hotel, where we arranged a discount room rate, sold out the block.  They have now added a small number of double rooms but we have arranged an “overflow” at the Charlesmark Hotel across from the Boston Public Library.  If you haven’t yet booked for the conference and/or for accommodation now would be a very good time!  Booking details and full details of the conference program can be found on [the Hydra Connect 2016 wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016).

**Lightning talks and workshop sessions**

The Program Committee has left space on the Wednesday morning for up to 24 lightning talks of no more than five minutes each.  If you’d like to take one of these slots to share some ideas/concerns/rants/raves or whatever, get planning – we’ll publish a sign-up list next Friday.  At the same time, we’ll mail registered delegates with details of how to sign up for Monday’s workshop sessions.  This process will allow us to judge the take-up for each one and assign rooms accordingly; it will also allow workshop coordinators to know who will be attending and to send out any advance information that they wish to provide.

**Unconference sessions**

Thursday morning at Hydra Connect will be given over to unconference sessions and we’ll provide details of the process for proposing these on 9th September.

 

We hope to see you in just about five weeks!
