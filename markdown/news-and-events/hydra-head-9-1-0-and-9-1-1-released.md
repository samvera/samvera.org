Weâ€™re pleased to announce that hydra-head 9.1.0 and 9.1.1 have been released.

Version 9.1.0 brings support for Blacklight 5.10. See the upgrade guide here:[https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/releases/tag/v9.1.0](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra-head/releases/tag/v9.1.0)

Version 9.1.1 fixes policy based access controls. They were not working in hydra-head 9 due to using incorrect Solr queries.

Thanks to Justin Coyne for the work.
