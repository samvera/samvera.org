## What is Hydra Virtual Connect?

Hydra Virtual Connect (HVC) is an opportunity for Hydra Project participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Hydra Connect meetings. Hydra is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. HVC will give the Hydra community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Hydra Connect 2016 in Boston in October.

Suggestions for an event such as this have come from a number of members of the Hydra community, and the idea was further discussed and refined at the Hydra Power Steering meeting in March 2016.

## When will Hydra Virtual Connect take place?

Hydra Virtual Connect 2016 will take place on **Thursday, July 7** from 11:00 AM – 2:00 PM EDT / 8:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT / 16:00-19:00 BST / 15:00-18:00 UTC.  Reserve the time slot!!!
