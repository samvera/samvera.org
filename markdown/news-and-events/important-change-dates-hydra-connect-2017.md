Apologies, but after our announcement, just before Christmas, of dates for Hydra Connect 2017 it became apparent that they clashed with a PASIG conference which, at that point, had not been widely advertised.  This would have represented a conflict of interest for a significant number of our Hydra community

Accordingly, the dates for Hydra Connect 2017 have been changed.  It will still be hosted by Northwestern University but the dates are now Monday November 6th – Thursday November 9th, 2017.  This year we have made the decision to use a conference hotel and the event will take place at the Hilton Orrington near the University.  Please update your calendars!

Further information via emails and the Hydra wiki in due course!
