We are delighted to announce that Lafayette College has become Hydra’s 100000th formal Partner.  But only if you count in binary – otherwise, they’re our 32nd!

Although Lafayette is a “small liberal arts school” (their words), they have been involved with digital repository development for almost a decade and with Fedora since 2013.  They write: “We have now spent over two years working with Hydra, getting to know the community and learning the Hydra way.  We are firmly committed to this trajectory and wish now to become more involved, both technically and through project governance.  We believe that a strengthened commitment would be of mutual benefit and, moreover, would serve as a compelling example for other liberal arts colleges that we are seeking to interest in shared Open Source development.”

Welcome Lafayette!  We look forward to working with you.
