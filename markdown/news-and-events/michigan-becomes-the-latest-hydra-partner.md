We are delighted to announce that the University of Michigan has become the latest formal Hydra Partner.  Maurice York, their Associate University Librarian for Library Information Technology, writes:

“The strength, vibrancy and richness of the Hydra community is compelling to us.  We are motivated by partnership and collaboration with this community, more than simply use of the technology and tools. The interest in and commitment to the community is organization-wide; last fall we sent over twenty participants to Hydra Connect from across five technology and service divisions; our showing this year will be equally strong, our enthusiasm tempered only by the registration limits.”

Welcome Michigan!  We look forward to a long collaboration with you.
