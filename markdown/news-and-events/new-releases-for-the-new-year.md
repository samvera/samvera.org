First of all, a Happy New Year to all our readers.

Just before the holiday period we released a number of new gems, most were minor point releases (Active Fedora 6.7.1-6.7.3 and Hydra Collections 1.3.2) but one was a major release of Sufia 3.6.0 (since patched to 3.6.1)

Thanks to all those who contributed. The current versions of all Hydra gems can be accessed throughÂ [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation](http://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Gems+and+documentation)
