We are pleased to announce some new gem releases:

### **Sufia 6.2.0** 

The 6.2.0 version of Sufia includes two new features \[1\]\[2\] on the administrative statistics page, allowing users to display a list of new user accounts and and list of deposited files based on a specified date range.

There have also been a handful of bug fixes, including:

\* Fixing the autocomplete dropdown that queries Geonames \[3\]

\* Restricting the display of collections in the “My” controller to those users can edit (not all collections they can view)

\* Disabling display of the Zotero user ID if this integration has not been enabled \[4\]

See the release notes \[5\] for the upgrade process and for an exhaustive list of the work that has gone into this release. Thanks to the 5 contributors for this release, which comprised 17 commits touching 27 files: Adam Wead, Olli Lyytinen, Justin Coyne, Michael J. Giarlo, and Carolyn Cole.

### **ActiveFedora 9.2.0 and HydraHead 9.2.0**

The upgrade to 9.2.0 is strongly encouraged as it fixes a bug where a user may retain access to a resource after the access has been revoked. Release notes are here:

Thanks again to all concerned.
