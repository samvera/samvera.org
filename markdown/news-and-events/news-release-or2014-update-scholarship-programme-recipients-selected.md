**OR2014 Update: Scholarship Programme Recipients Selected**

_Helsinki, FI_  Leading up to the kick-off of the [Ninth International Conference on Open Repositories](http://or2014.helsinki.fi/) (#OR2014) next week, the Open Repositories Steering Committee is pleased to announce that recipients of the 2014 Open Repositories Pilot Scholarship Programme have been selected. The Pilot Scholarship Programme is providing financial support for three first-time delegates to attend this year’s conference in Helsinki, June 9-13. The recipients, who are from Estonia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, were among a strong pool of applicants.

The Open Repositories Steering Committee instituted the Scholarship Programme to encourage participation by librarians, repository managers, developers and researchers in digital libraries and related fields, who might not otherwise have the resources to attend Open Repositories. The Scholarship Programme covers the cost of full registration, including the conference dinner. We look forward to welcoming the scholarship recipients, and all delegates, to Helsinki next week.
