If you have questions related to conference registration, you can contact them directly at or-2014\[at\][tavicon.fi](https://mail.hull.ac.uk/owa/redir.aspx?C=-MgwLsG8L0eb8P7LXoZR6H9jW1qyAtEIsrLQhhKfez9wrQF962eJEtQUmHQ2JT9pZ8LvgfK4AZU.&URL=http%3a%2f%2ftavicon.fi%2f).

**Pilot scholarship programme**

A highlight of this year’s conference is the availability of delegate scholarships for the first time. The Open Repositories Steering Committee is delighted to announce a pilot Scholarship Programme for OR2014. This programme aims to expand participation by providing registration support for a small number of delegates to this year’s conference. The scholarship programme is open to librarians, repository managers, developers and researchers in digital libraries and related fields.

Please note: the OR2014 scholarship programme provides a full discount for conference registration and the conference dinner. It does not cover other costs including accommodation, travel and subsistence. It is anticipated that the applicant’s home institution will provide financial support to supplement an OR scholarship award.

**Only fully-completed applications will be accepted**. The deadline for applications is Sunday, March 14, 2014.

You may apply for funding here: [http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page\_id=412](http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=412)
