Of interest to many Hydranauts:

The [Tenth International Conference on Open Repositories](http://www.or2015.net/), OR2015, will be held on June 8-11, 2015 in Indianapolis (Indiana, USA). The organizers are pleased to invite you to contribute to the program. This year’s conference theme is:

**LOOKING BACK, MOVING FORWARD: OPEN REPOSITORIES AT THE CROSSROADS**

OR2015 is the tenth OR conference, and this year’s overarching theme reflects that milestone: Looking Back/Moving Forward: Open Repositories at the Crossroads. It is an opportunity to reflect on and to celebrate the transformative changes in repositories, scholarly communication and research data over the last decade. More critically however, it will also help to ensure that open repositories continue to play a key role in supporting, shaping and sharing those changes and an open agenda for research and scholarship.
