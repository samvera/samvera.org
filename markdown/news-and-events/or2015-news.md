**OR2015 NEWS: Preliminary Program Information Now Available; Remember to Register and Reserve Your Hotel Room**

From the OR2015 Program Co-Chairs:

We are pleased to announce that information on accepted paper, panel, and 24×7 sessions at Open Repositories 2015 is now available on the OR2015 conference website: [http://www.or2015.net/](http://www.or2015.net/)

Open Repositories 2015, taking place in Indianapolis on June 8-11, received an unprecedented number of proposals this year, with 240 proposals submitted across the conference and interest group tracks. This has also been the most selective Open Repositories, and only 38% of conference paper and panels were accepted in the main track. We have accepted 6 panels, 21 24×7’s (including Rants and Raves), 37 papers and 60 posters which will all give an exciting snapshot of work in the open repositories community.

The Program Committee would like to take this opportunity to again thank all of our reviewers who took time to review workshops, papers, panels, 24×7’s and posters. Please stay tuned for more information on the schedule and interest group presentations, which we will post later in April.
