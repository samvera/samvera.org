Dear Colleagues,

We are pleased to announce that full program and schedule details for Open Repositories 2015, taking place in Indianapolis on June 8-11, are now available on the conference website at [http://www.or2015.net/](http://www.or2015.net/)

The program for this 10th Open Repositories conference includes:

– keynote talks from Kaitlin Thaney of Mozilla Science Lab and Anurag Acharya of Google Scholar

– a mix of workshops, tutorials, papers, panels, 24×7 presentations, posters, and “repository rants and raves” addressing a wide variety of topics related to digital repositories and the roles they play in supporting open scholarship, open science, online cultural heritage, and research data

– a Developer Track that includes informal  presentations and demonstrations showcasing community expertise and progress

– interest group sessions focused on the open source DSpace, EPrints, and Fedora (including Hydra and Islandora) repository platforms

– an Ideas Challenge enabling small teams to collaborate on proposing new ideas for moving repositories forward (with prizes)

Coupled with a variety of social activities to help support networking with colleagues from across the globe, along with exhibit tables from conference sponsors, OR2015 should make for a rewarding experience for anyone working in the repositories space.
