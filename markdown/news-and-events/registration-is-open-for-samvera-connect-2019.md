We’re delighted to announce that registration is now open for Samvera Connect 2019 to be held at Washington University in St Louis 22-25 October.  An early bird price of $265 will apply until 12th September, after which it will be $285.  We shall be able to offer a small number of scholarships, covering registration and hotel costs, and details of these will be released in a few weeks.  Full details of the conference, including the registration details, can be found via its web gateway at [https://connect2019.samvera.org](https://connect2019.samvera.org).

The CfP for the workshops to be held on 22nd October is now closed and a full list is available [via the website](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2019%3A++Program) or via Sched (sc2019).  The CfP for presentations and panels is open and [details can be found here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2019%3A+Calls+for+Proposals).  As in the past, our goal is to serve the needs of attendees from an ever-widening range of experience and background (potential adopters, new adopters, expert Samverans; developers, managers, sysops, metadata librarians, etc.).  Please consider what you might propose to help this be another very successful event.

Please feel free to share this announcement with other interested colleagues and relevant mailing lists.
