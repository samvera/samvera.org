The Samvera Connect 2018 (SC18) Salt Lake City hosting committee is excited to announce that [registration](https://umarket.utah.edu/um2/marriottlib/product.php?product=9) for the annual Samvera Connect conference is now open. Samvera Connect 2018 will take place from October 9-12 and is hosted by the University of Utah, J. Willard Marriott Library.

The overall schedule will remain similar to those of years past, but this year the SC18 conference will begin on Tuesday and finish on Friday. More information on the schedule format can be found on the [Samvera Connect 2018 wiki](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2018)

We have also created a [Samvera Connect 2018 website](https://connect2018.lib.utah.edu/) that provides helpful information about lodging, transportation, dining, family resources, and additional information about Â the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, and Utah to help plan your visit.

As the saying goes, If you can only make it to one Samvera meeting in 2018, this is the one to attend!

We look forwarding to seeing everyone at Samvera Connect 2018!
