Just a reminder (echoing an e-mail sent to email lists by the Open Repositories Steering Committee) that Expressions of Interest in hosting OR2016 are due by August 24th.  The EoI is a very straightforward email – full details at [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/or11/Call+for+Expressions+of+Interest+in+hosting+OR+2016](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/or11/Call+for+Expressions+of+Interest+in+hosting+OR+2016)

OR2014, held in Helsinki just a few weeks ago, was hugely successful and attracted nearly 500 delegates from all over the world.  Hosting OR is a good way of getting your institution noticed!!!  OR2015 will be in Indianapolis 8-11 June jointly organised by Indiana University,  the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Virginia Tech.
