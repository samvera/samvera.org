Samvera Connect 2017 "hosted by Northwestern University Libraries in partnership with the University of Michigan Libraries, on Chicago's beautiful north shore" saw more than 170 people come together for a hugely successful conference.  Our sincere thanks to all those involved in the organization of this year's event.

It was announced during the main plenary session that Connect 2018 will be held at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, probably in the first part of October but exact dates to be confirmed.  You know what we say: "As a Samvera Partner or user, or maybe just interested in finding out more, if you can only make it to one Samvera meeting next academic year,  _this is the one to attend!"_
