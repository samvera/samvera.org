Samvera Connect is the annual meeting of the community behind best in class open source digital library web applications for libraries, archives, and museums. Not only does this community work together on applications, they are on the forefront for community discussions of linked data, digital preservation, and accessibility.

This conference presents an opportunity for vendors, organizations, and projects to show their support for open and community-driven software solutions for preserving and presenting cultural and scholarly assets for the world.

**Who We Are**

Conceived and executed under its original name “Hydra,” the Samvera Community has been a collaborative effort from its very beginning in 2008 and has grown into an international community including more than 30 Partner organizations who formally contribute to our work and development.
