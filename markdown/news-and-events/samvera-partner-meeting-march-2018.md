There will be a Samvera Partner meeting at Stanford University on Thursday 29th and Friday 30th March 2018 following on immediately from the annual LDCX meeting.

As with all Samvera Partner meetings, the event will be open to both Partners and interested parties. We anticipate topics to include governance, resourcing, planning, the annual report, and fund raising.

If you plan to attend, please add your name to the [list here](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/March+2018+Samvera+Partner+Meeting+Agenda) and also add any additional agenda items that you would like to discuss.  The agenda will be ordered and refined nearer the meeting.
