Organizations active in the Samvera Community can become [Samvera Partners](https://samvera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/samvera/pages/1872461833/About+Samvera+Partners), and make a commitment to support the Community through participation and annual dues. Get to know Hyku for Consortia, one of the newest Samvera Partners. 

[Hyku for Consortia](https://www.hykuforconsortia.org/) is developing an affordable, open-source, and collaborative institutional repository solution based on Samvera’s Hyku software. This use case has the potential to extend Samvera’s Hyku adoption well beyond institutions with significant technical resources to also serve those that will benefit from a low-cost, flexible out-of-the-box solution that scales to meet the needs of groups. The project intends to leverage the software to offer this shared service and develop an active community of practice that has implemented Hyku as both individual repository solutions, and as a collaborative solution in support of group efforts, such as repositories for regional open educational resources.

Hyku for Consortia is a joint project of [PALNI](https://www.palni.org/) (Private Academic Library Network of Indiana) and [PALCI](https://palci.org/) (Partnership for Academic Library Collaboration and Innovation). PALNI and PALCI began investigating Hyku for their consortial use case in 2017, and in 2019 were awarded their first of two grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to develop the Hyku repository software into a meaningful solution for library consortia.

Hyku for Consortia project staff actively participate in the Community at Hyku Interest Group meetings, Partner calls, and Community strategic planning. They have already contributed and plan to continue contributing the project’s code, documentation, presentations and other forms of communication, support, funding, and other resources.
