Don't forget that this year's Samvera Virtual Connect is coming up soon!

Tuesday, July 18, 2017

11:00 AM - 2:00 PM EDT / 8:00 AM â€“ 11:00 AM PDT / 16:00-19:00 BST / 15:00-18:00 UTC

Samvera Virtual Connect is an opportunity for Samvera Community participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings. Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera Community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Samvera Connect 2017 in Evanston in November.

For more information, and **to register**, go to [SVC's wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2017).
