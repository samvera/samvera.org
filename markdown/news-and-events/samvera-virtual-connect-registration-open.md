This year's event will be held on Wednesday, 11 July 2018 from 11:00 AM - 2:30 PM EDT / 8:00 AM – 11:30 AM PDT / 16:00-19:30 BST / 15:00-18:30 UTC.

Samvera Virtual Connect (SVC), is an opportunity for Samvera Community participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings. Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards [Samvera Connect 2018](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Connect+2018) in Salt Lake City in October.  See the [Virtual Connect wiki page](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2018) for further information.
