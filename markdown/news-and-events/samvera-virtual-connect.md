This year's Samvera Virtual Connect will take place on 14th and 14th May.

Samvera Virtual Connect (SVC), is an opportunity for Samvera Community participants to gather online to touch base on the progress of community efforts at a roughly halfway point between face-to-face Samvera Connect meetings. Samvera is a growing, active community with many initiatives taking place across interest groups, working groups, local and collaborative development projects, and other efforts, and it can be difficult for community members to keep up with all of this activity on a regular basis. SVC will give the Samvera community a chance to come together to catch up on developments, make new connections, and re-energize itself towards Samvera Connect 2020.

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Fall conference this year will also take place on line - we're busy working on the details.  In the meantime, why not join us for the Spring event?  [All the details are here](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/samvera/Samvera+Virtual+Connect+2020).
