Following on from the very successful event in San Diego earlier this year, we are delighted to announce that the second Hydra Connect meeting will take place from Tuesday 30 September to Friday 3 October, 2014.  This is in line with the requests from many attendees at Connect #1 that these meetings should be held in the Fall.

The meeting will take place at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.  As before, the Tuesday will be a day of workshops whilst the main meeting from Wednesday to Friday will be a mixture of plenary and breakout sessions.

We anticipate sending out further details (including booking procedures for the conference itself and for hotels) in mid/late June.  In the meantime, save the dates in your diary!  There are preliminary details on the Hydra wiki at: [Hydra Connect 2 – Fall 2014](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2+-+Fall+2014) and we shall keep that page updated as the event gets closer.

As we’ve said before:  “as a Hydra Partner or user, if you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in an academic year, _this is the one to attend!”_
