Some dates for your 2020 diaries:

Samvera Connect 2020 will take place during the week beginning Monday 26th October, hosted by the University of California at Santa Barbara.  The week will include a one-day Partner Meeting, and in parallel with that, a Developer Congress.  Whilst the dates are fixed, you should not make any assumptions at this stage about what will happen on any given day.  It has been pointed out that Halloween is at the end of the week and people with young families may wish to get home for it – the conference organizers are considering how best to facilitate that, probably this will involve changing the order of things from the ‘traditional’ timetable.
