As 2020 draws to a close, we want to share our gratitude for each and every person who has helped the Samvera Community thrive in this difficult year of profound loss and challenge. We could not be the vibrant, welcoming, and valuable open source solution community we are without each and every person who contributed code or documentation, helped answer a question, served on a Working or Interest Group or as a Community Helper, or helped make Samvera Connect On-line a successful event.

We also want to thank everyone who attended an event, joined the conversation on Slack, or reached out for more information. Weâ€™re grateful for your interest and happy to further connect you to the community.

We hope you will join us in looking forward to 2021 with renewed energy and excitement about what we can accomplish as we go further, together.
