Towards the end of 2019, we were made aware of two new Samvera-based repositories that you may like to take a look at:

The Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary has produced an innovative site which can be driven from a scrolling timeline (as well as a conventional search).  The [SEBTS site can be found here.](https://archives.sebts.edu/)

The British Library has developed a joint research database in collaboration with a number of partners: National Museums Scotland, Tate, MOLA, British Museum and Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. The system is built in Samvera Hyku and was developed in collaboration with Ubiquity Press. Each Partner has their own repository but there is a single search portal which interrogates all of them.  The [portal is here](https://iro.bl.uk), and there's a very [full blog post about the system here](https://blogs.bl.uk/living-knowledge/2019/11/british-library-shared-research-repository-launched-in-beta.html).

Congratulations on both of them!
