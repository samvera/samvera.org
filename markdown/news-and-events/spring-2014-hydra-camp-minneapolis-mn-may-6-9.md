DCE is pleased to announce their next Hydra Camp, to be held in Minneapolis from May 6-9, 2014.  They’re really excited to be hosting the event at [Open Book](http://www.openbookmn.org/), home of the Minnesota Center for Book Arts.  Since they’re hosting at home, the whole DCE team will be joining in.  They’re also looking forward to showing off a few of their favorite spots after class!

Feel free to e-mail [Mark Bussey at DCE](mailto:mark@curationexperts.com) if you have any questions that aren’t answered by the registration or overview links.  If you’re interested in attending Hydra Camp, but can’t make the May class, they’ll also be holding a second Hydra Camp in Fall of this year somewhere in the Boston or New York vicinity – details will be announced in June.

Remember that DCE are also leading [Hydra Camp in Dublin from April 8-11](https://hydracamp-dublin2014.eventbrite.com/) if that fits your travel profile better.
