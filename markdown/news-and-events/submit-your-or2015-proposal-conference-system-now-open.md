Of interest to the Hydra Community:

The Tenth International Conference on Open Repositories, OR2015, will be held June 8-11, 2015 in Indianapolis (Indiana, USA). The organizers are pleased to invite you to contribute to the program.

The conference theme is LOOKING BACK, MOVING FORWARD: OPEN REPOSITORIES AT THE CROSSROADS. It is an opportunity to reflect on and to celebrate the transformative changes in repositories, scholarly communication, and research data over the last decade. More critically, however, it will also help to ensure that open repositories continue to play a key role in supporting, shaping, and sharing those changes and an open agenda for research and scholarship.

The organizers invite you to review the full call for proposals here: [http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/](http://www.or2015.net/call-for-proposals/), and to submit your proposal here: [https://www.conftool.com/or2015/](https://www.conftool.com/or2015/) by January 30, 2015. There are several different formats provided to encourage your participation in this year’s conference, all described on the OR2015 website.
