From Adam Wead:

It gives me great pleasure to formally announce the release of the Hydra gem Sufa, version 4.0.  This release marks the culmination of 5 months’ work of collaborative development with the members of Penn State’s Services and Solutions team and Digital Curation Experts (DCE).

This new version includes a complete redesign of Sufia’s user interface, based on user feedback and design studies conducted with the staff and faculty at Penn State University.  Sufia’s features now include:

- Multiple file, or folder, upload
- Flexible user- and group-based access controls
- Transcoding of audio and video files
- Generation and validation of identifiers
- Fixity checking
- Version control
- Characterization of uploaded files
- Forms for batch editing metadata
- Faceted search and browse
- Social media interaction
- User profiles
- User dashboard for file management
- Highlighted files on profile
- Sharing w/ groups and users
- User notifications
- Activity streams
- Background jobs
- Single-use links
- Google Analytics for usage statistics
- Integration w/ cloud storage providers
- Google Scholar-specific metadata embedding
- Schema.org microdata, Open Graph meta tags, and Twitter cards for rich snippets
- User-managed collections for grouping files
- Full-text indexing & searching
- Responsive, fluid, Bootstrap 3-based UI
- Dynamically configurable featured works and researchers on homepage
