We are pleased to announce the release of version 4.3.1 of the Sufia gem.  (The 4.3.0 version was a misfire, so the upgrade path goes from 4.2.0 directly to 4.3.1.)

The 4.3.1 release of Sufia includes the ability to store users’ ORCID identifiers and display them in the user profile, and includes enhancements to usage statistics. It also includes support for Blacklight 5.8 and a good number of bugfixes.

Thanks to Carolyn Cole, Michael Tribone, Valerie Maher, Adam Wead, Misty DeMeo, and Mike Giarlo for their work on this release.
