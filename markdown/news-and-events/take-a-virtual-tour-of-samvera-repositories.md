The [Samvera Repository Online Tour](https://samvera.org/samvera-open-source-repository-framework/take-a-tour-of-active-samvera-repositories/) provides an overview of a range of Samvera-based digital repositories and their collections at institutions across the US and UK. Click through to explore how Samvera technologies allow institutions and organizations to organize and provide access to diverse materials -- from oral histories and historic photographs, to student projects and research data. 

The tour was planned by the Samvera Marketing Working Group and created using [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com/) by Lafayette College Libraries student workers Grayce Walker, Deja Jackson, and Khaknazar Shyntassov. A huge thanks to them, as well as to Charlotte Nunes at Lafayette College Libraries Digital Scholarship Services for coordinating the work.

If you’d like to include your Samvera-based repository on the tour, simply [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/siwPitQHRb3W5LA28).
