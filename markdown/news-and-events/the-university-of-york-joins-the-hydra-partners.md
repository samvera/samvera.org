The University of York, in the UK, has become Hydra’s 31st formal Partner..

In York’s Letter of Intent, Sarah Thompson (the Head of Collections, Library and Archives) writes:

“To date we have contributed to a Hydra Interest Group on page turning, submitted a code improvement to one of the Hydra Labs projects and have launched our first Fedora 4 and Hydra application: [York Archbishops’ Registers Revealed](http://archbishopsregisters.york.ac.uk/).  This project has allowed us to explore allied initiatives such as IIIF and work around PCDM, and it is encouraging to see so much joined up activity happening across the community.

“We hope that as our expertise with Hydra develops, so will our contributions to the community.”

Welcome York!  We look forward to working with you further.
