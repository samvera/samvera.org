We are delighted to announce that Tufts University has become the latest formal Hydra Partner.  Tufts has two Hydra-based projects, the Tufts Digital Library redesign and a New Nation Votes election portal. They are currently working on a Hydra-based administrative interface to allow staff self-deposit in the Tufts Fedora content repository; and the Tufts Digital Image Library, based on Northwestern’s DIL implementation.

In their Letter of Intent, Tufts say that they are committed to the Hydra community in helping solve digital repository and workflow challenges by supporting development and contributing code, documentation and expertise.

Welcome, Tufts!
