We are delighted to announce that Ubiquity Press has become a formal Samvera Partner.  Ubiquity Press is an open access publisher and they are working with the British Library, the national library of the United Kingdom, to develop shared open-source repository services using Hyku, our multi-tenant software solution.  The pilot repository will initially include research outputs from the British Library, the British Museum, the Tate galleries, National Museums Scotland, and the Museum of London Archaeology.  In the US, Ubiquity Press is also working with Gonzaga University, Penn State University, the University of Pennsylvania and Western University.

We greatly look forward to working more closely with them!
