We are delighted to announce that the University of California at Santa Barbara has become the latest Hydra Partner.

UC Santa Barbara has been successfully running the Alexandria Digital Research Library (ADRL) using a production instance of Hydra since 2013, at [http://alexandria.ucsb.edu](http://alexandria.ucsb.edu).  The repository initially launched hosting Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETDs) and has grown to include various born digital and digitized archival images.  Most recently they have implemented access to their collection of more than 10,000 wax cylinder recordings held by the Department of Special Research Collections.

The UC Santa Barbara team have been active participants in the community, not only attending every Hydra Connect to-date, but also by hosting community events such as Hydra Camp and the first West Coast regional Hydra meet up.

The team is putting the final touches on a release of ADRL that will provide access to digitized versions of their scanned map collections.  This release will highlight the use of Hydra to navigate complex object relationships and leverage Open SeaDragon and IIIF technologies to provide deep zoom interaction with high-resoultion scans.  This functionality will be rolled out later this year with an even larger GIS initiative following shortly after.

We welcome UCSB to the Partnership and look forward to even more collaboration with them in the future!
