If you're reading this, it's likely that you have found Samvera's new website.  Welcome!

The new site has been long in the making and was much delayed by our rebranding as Samvera.  We'd like to express particular thanks to Jeremy Brant for all the work he has put into the design and for his patience over the many months since we started the process.

You might like to note that one of the "hidden" features of this work is that samvera.org/wiki resolves to the Samvera wiki space - a much easier URL than was needed in the past.

Enjoy!
