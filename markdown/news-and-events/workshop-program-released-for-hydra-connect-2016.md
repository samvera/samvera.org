The Hydra Connect 2016 Program Committee is pleased to announce that the timetable for the Workshop day on Monday 3rd October is now available.  This year, in addition to workshops, we are also providing a half-day of optional “orientation sessions” aimed specifically at new or nearly-new members of the Community.  Workshop convenors have provided [a synopsis for each session](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016%3A++Workshops) and these should help you choose between them.  Nearer the time, we shall ask those who have registered for Connect to specify which workshops they plan to attend so that we can allocate sessions to appropriately sized rooms.  Further details of the conference program will be available soon.

Speaking of “registered” – have you registered for Hydra Connect 2016 yet?  This year it’s taking place at the Boston Public Library (with some workshops at Northeastern University) from Monday 3rd October to Thursday 6th October 2016.  Tickets for the four-day event are $135 and we have arranged a preferential hotel rate at the nearby Sheraton.  Information about the conference, booking, workshops etc can be found via the Hydra Connect 2016 wiki page at [https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016).  We are delighted, thanks to the assistance our Hydra Community, to provide[selected materials in Spanish](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/hydra/Hydra+Connect+2016#HydraConnect2016-%C2%BFQu%C3%A9esHydraConnect?) this year!

We will be asking each institution sending delegates to the conference to provide a poster for the Tuesday afternoon Poster Session. We’ll have plenty of lightning talks and breakout sessions as well. Start thinking of your great ideas now!   You’ll be hearing from us on these topics soon.

If you can only make it to one Hydra meeting in 2016/17, **this is the one to attend!**  You know what they say, “book early to avoid disappointment!”
