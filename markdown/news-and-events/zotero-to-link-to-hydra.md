A project has recently been announced which is a partnership between George Mason University (Zotero) and Penn State University, with the goal of further customizing Zotero and creating a linkage between Zotero and Hydra-based repositories.  It will add functionality to the Zotero client software to allow users to assert authorship over their own scholarship and to indicate whether they hold the copyright to such materials. It will also develop a pluggable backend for Zotero that will allow any repository to draw such content from the Zotero ecosystem. The first implementation will involve linking Penn State’s institutional repository, ScholarSphere, a Fedora repository built on a Hydra-based platform.  The results of this collaboration will provide open-source code for others in the Hydra community and an open API for adopters of other repository software (e.g., DSpace, Islandora, EPrints) to link institutional and subject repositories to Zotero.
