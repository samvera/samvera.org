## The Samvera Community persists because of many types of contributions – of code, volunteer time, and money – that maintain our community infrastructure. 


### Financial Contributions

Samvera infrastructure is supported by [Samvera Partner dues](https://samvera.org/the-community/samvera-partners) as well as contributions from other institutions that value the community. Contributions are always welcome and appreciated. See the latest [Samvera Annual Report](https://samvera.org/news-and-events/samvera-annual-report) for details of how Samvera uses contributed funds.

 To make a one-time or annual contribution outside of Partnership, please [contact Heather Greer Klein, Samvera Community Manager](mailto:heather@samvera.org).
