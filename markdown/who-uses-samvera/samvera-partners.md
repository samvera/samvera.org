The Samvera Community is built around a core group of Partners committed to the success of the project and more importantly to the success of each other.  There are also many institutions and individuals that have formally committed to the sustainability of the Community through code contributions, participation in working or interest groups, helping with documentation, design, or planning.  No contribution is too small.  If you are interested in contributing to the Samvera Community or just interested in Samvera in general read more about the Community [here](https://samvera.org/hydra-partners/community-framework/). The number of Samvera Partners has grown steadily worldwide.

The Hydra Project, Samvera's original name, was founded in 2008 by:

- Stanford University
- University of Virginia
- University of Hull
- Fedora (now part of DuraSpace)

quickly augmented by:

- MediaShelf LLC which later evolved into Data Curation Experts

The three founding universities are still very active and, together with Data Curation Experts, continue to contribute to the work of the Samvera Community.  DuraSpace withdrew from formal Partnership in 2020 following their merger with Lyrasis but is still active in supporting the Community.
