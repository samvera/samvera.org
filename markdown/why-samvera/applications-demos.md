#### Solution bundles

The Avalon website includes the facility to [try a demonstration system](http://www.avalonmediasystem.org/try-out-avalon).

**Hyku** - is the product from the Hydra-in-a-Box project to create a turnkey version of Samvera. Hyku can be installed locally or provided as a cloud service; it can be configured for single or multi-tenant use. The Ruby gem underlying Hyku is Hyrax and it can be used as the basis for a customized, locally developed version of Samvera - it is not, in and of itself, a solution bundle.
