The Samvera framework uses the best of current repository, search, and user-interface technologies. The separation of data and display, within the Samvera framework, promotes flexibility and extensibility.

#### Flexible

Within the Samvera framework, one "body" -- the digital repository -- supports multiple "heads" or tailored, content type-specific applications.

![Samvera repository structure](../images/HydraContentStructure4.gif) Where other repository systems may be tailored to a specific format or medium, requiring specific systems and expertise, the Samvera framework is flexible enough to serve multiple needs.

#### Extensible

The Samvera framework is architected to extend features based on specific concerns and use-cases. Established features with long-term community commitment are available, such as:

- [Browse Everything](https://github.com/projecthydra/browse-everything) allows your rails application to access user files from cloud storage, such as Dropbox, Skydrive, Google Drive, Box, and a server-side directory share
- [LDP](https://github.com/projecthydra/ldp) provides a Linked Data Platform and allows publication of RDF data

The agile and collaborative nature of the Samvera Community also enables experimentation with cutting-edge extensions, which can be added to address unique needs, explore usefulness and possibilities, and eventually gain community commitment.
