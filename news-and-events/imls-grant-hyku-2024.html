It aims to strengthen collaborative efforts to ensure Hyku remains a viable, efficient, and sustainable solution for managing and preserving digital content across a diverse range of institutions.</p><p>“Open-source infrastructure software like Hyku allows libraries, museums, and other cultural institutions to create customized solutions while enabling them to collaborate on managing these services more effectively and cost-efficiently,&quot; says <b>Kirsten Leonard</b>, PALNI Executive Director. &quot;This project aims to support a community organizational structure that enhances software development efficiency while allowing each project to prioritize its specific needs.&quot;</p><h2>Partners in digital repository development</h2><p>Hyku, a multi-tenant repository software within the Samvera open-source community, provides a cost-effective and user-friendly platform for institutions to manage, preserve, and provide access to digital collections, including academic papers and archival materials. Since 2018, PALCI and PALNI have played a significant role in Hyku’s development, supported by <a href="https://hykuforconsortia.palni.org/news/palni-and-palci-successfully-conclude-imls-grant-to-remove-barriers-to-hyku-adoption"><u>two previous IMLS grants</u></a> under their Hyku for Consortia initiative.</p><p>With this newly awarded grant, PALCI and PALNI will enhance Hyku’s community stewardship overall, leveraging the expertise, resources, and investments of diverse Samvera community members—including both large and small Hyku implementers and users, Hyrax users, and service providers like Software Services by Scientist.com (SoftServ). </p><h2>Affordable, open-source solutions that scale</h2><p>Hyku offers a customizable, open-source alternative that meets the specific needs of diverse institutions, providing much-needed relief from budget constraints many libraries face. This initiative will benefit a wide range of organizations by making Hyku a more reliable and efficient tool for managing digital content. In addition to fostering collaboration among Hyku’s user community, the project will ensure that development efforts align with the needs of all users.</p><p>“This grant is a significant step forward in ensuring Hyku remains a sustainable and accessible option for libraries of all sizes and budgets,” says <b>Jill Morris</b>, PALCI Executive Director. “We are stewarding limited community resources and sharing capacity and expertise across organizations to provide the high-quality digital repository services that are increasingly crucial in today’s digital landscape.”</p><h2>Long-term code and community sustainability</h2><p>By investing in Hyku’s development, PALCI and PALNI are helping to create a more inclusive and accessible digital infrastructure for the library community now and in the future. “As more institutions adopt Hyku,” adds <b>Amanda Hurford</b>, PALNI Scholarly Communications Director, “it’s essential to have a solid collaborative and governance framework for ongoing development and support. This grant will ensure libraries can continue to provide customized access to important and unique digital content through greater coordination among the various groups and developers working on Hyku.”
